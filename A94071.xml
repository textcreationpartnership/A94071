            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>God having now <hi>opened the graves of his people, commanded deliverances for</hi> Jacob, <hi>and turned their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity as the Rivers in the South, ſent forth his priſoners by the blood of the Covenant, out of the pit in which there was no water, Chap.</hi> 9.11. being now come again into their own Land, they were apt to pleaſe themſelves with thoughts of eaſe and peace, as if they ſhould now
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:168372:2"/> live in an Ile of providence, where they ſhould enjoy a perpetual ſummer: therefore in this cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity the Lord doth fore-warn them of greater ſufferings that they were to undergo in the laſt times.</p>
               <p>Wherein we have firſt the Judgement it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, ſetting forth an utter over-throw, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conqueſt: <hi>the day of the Lord cometh, when the ſpoil ſhall be divided in the middle of thee, ver.</hi> 12. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> muſt needs be underſtood <hi>deultima clade,</hi> of the laſt deſtruction of their City, and the preſent diſſipation of their Nation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is a deſcription of their miſerable condition at this time: <hi>the light ſhall not be clear nor dark, ver.</hi> 6. <hi>non ſtabilis aliqua temporum ratio,</hi> there ſhall be nothing certain: in doubtful times we are ſubject al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to new fears: daily changes are continual dangers: <hi>quaſi in continuo crepuſculo,</hi> it ſhall be neither day nor night, mixtures of hope and fear: they cannot ſay it is ſo dark as there is an end of their hopes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor ſo light as there is an end of their fears.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, after this he comforts his Church with an aſſurance of deliverance, and that by divers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, though it were ſharp, yet it ſhould be ſhort, but <hi>as one day: for a thouſand years with the Lord is but as one day: and a day that the Lord knoweth;</hi> that is, he hath limited, for <hi>the deſolations are determined,</hi> Dan. 9.26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the iſſue ſhall be happy; though the day ſhould neither be clear nor dark, yet he promiſes <hi>laetum fore exitum,</hi> the evening ſhall be light.</p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:168372:2"/>
               <p>Thirdly, the Author of their deliverance ſhall be <hi>Jehovah: he that before gathered all Nations againſt Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, ver.</hi> 2. he that provided <hi>the thorns to ſcatter Judah,</hi> provided alſo <hi>the carpenters</hi> to fray them away, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.20,21. <hi>then ſhall Iehovah go forth and fight againſt this Nation,</hi> ver. 3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the manner of the deliverance, God ſhall ſo do it, that he will make it appear to be his work. God doth many things by ſecond cauſes, wherein his hand doth not ſo clearly appear: his hand is in his glove, his arm in his ſleeve: but when it doth appear to be wholy his work, then <hi>he doth make bare his arm in the ſight of the Nations, Iſa</hi> 52.10 The Lord ſhould be as plainly ſeen here, as if his feet did ſtand upon Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, the glorious condition of this Church after this deliverance, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, after this Jeruſalem ſhall be made eminent and honourable: <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſtood in a Valley, and the Mount of Olives hid it, that it could not be ſeen: but now, <hi>the Mount ſhall cleave aſunder in the midſt, and all ſhall become a plain:</hi> what ever might hinder the ſight of the glory of the City, or elſe might hinder the flocking in of her own people and of all Nations to her. God will remove great obſtacles: Mounts ſhall not ſtand in the way of his people, either to hinder their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or to over ſhaddow their glory; <hi>Who art thou Oh great Mountain, that thou ſhouldſt ſtand before</hi> Zorobabel? <hi>thou ſhalt become a plain,</hi> cap. 4.7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after this deliverance Jeruſalem ſhall be exalted, as the mother Church, &amp; then <hi>living waters ſhal go forth of Ieruſalem unto the uttermoſt parts of the earth, Ver.</hi> 8. which was in a meaſure accompliſhed when the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:168372:3"/> Law went out of <hi>Zion,</hi> but it was not fulfilled; for this fountain in Ieruſalem was ſoon dryed up; and therefore here is ſome further thing aimed at; for the promiſe is, <hi>ſummer and winter ſhall they run,</hi> and therefore I doubt not from hence to conclude, that after the coming in of the Iews, great profit and enlargement both in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and graces ſhall come upon all the Gentile Churches.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the bleſſed and glorious Government of this ſtate after this deliverance; the Lord had for their ſins broken both <hi>the ſtaff of beauty and the ſtaff of bonds,</hi> by which he fed them in times paſt, but now he would return and be their King again; for ſo I ſhould rather expreſs he Emphatical particle <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſuper totam ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram illam;</hi> And it is exceeding probable, that after their converſion the Lord ſhall in a more glorious manner undertake the Government of that people: ſurely it is not for nothing that it is ſo often repeated, <hi>And</hi> David <hi>my ſervant ſhall be their Prince for ever,</hi> Ezek. 37.24,25.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, here is the fruit and conſequence of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that is double in this verſe, <hi>Iehovah ſhall be one, and his name one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We know the name of God is exceeding diverſly taken in the Scripture; but here I conceive is meant the Religion that God hath ſet forth in his word, and the worſhip that he hath ſet up in the Church; ſo I conceive it is uſed in <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.5. <hi>All people will walk every man in the name of his God, &amp; we wil walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever:</hi> that is, the greateſt part of the world, as their gods are Idols, ſo they are addicted unto a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious worſhip of theſe according to the inventions of men; but as our God is but one, and his rule of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:168372:3"/> one: this worſhip according unto this rule we will keep our ſelves to, and never change for any humane invention ſo long as the world ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
               <p>So that the meaning of the promiſe ſeems to be this; whereas before they worſhiped many Gods; <hi>as there be Gods many, and Lord, many;</hi> they ſerved both the Idols of their hearts, and of their hands; now they ſhould <hi>turn from dead Idols, and ſerve only the living God:</hi> they ſhould ſay, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> and then, <hi>Iehovah ſhall be one:</hi> And whereas in the times of their ignorance as they ſerved many Gods, ſo in the worſhip of theſe Gods they had many ſuperſtitious and carnal rites, according as every mans fancy led him: and ſo there were as many names, and ſeveral names of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as they had many Gods. But now the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that as all the Idols ſhall be taken away, ſo all Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious worſhip alſo, ſo that there ſhall be but one God, and one name. <hi>Iehovah</hi> one, the rule of his worſhip one, and his worſhip according to that rule ſhall be one.</p>
               <p>One name. Philoſophers tell us that <hi>unum non ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addit enti aliquid poſitivum ſed tantum negationem Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitionis &amp; diviſionis. Aquin.</hi> par. 1. q 11. a.i. A denial both of multitude and mixtures.</p>
               <p>So we ſee God is One; that is, there is none elſe: none beſides; and that ſtands in oppoſition unto many; and God is One, that is, he hath a ſimple being, <hi>&amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid eſt in Deo, Deus eſt,</hi> in oppoſition unto mixture: ſo that Firſt <hi>his name ſhall be One,</hi> to ſet out his purity, that his worſhip it ſhall not be mixed <hi>with the inventions</hi> of men no more. Secondly, his name One, that is, the Religion ſhall be the ſame amongſt them all; it notes
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:168372:4"/> the identity of it; ſo that though now there be many every where, but then they ſhall have <hi>One heart and one way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will begin with the firſt, unity as it ſtands oppoſed unto compoſition ſetting forth the ſimplicity of Gods worſhip; it ſhall be no more mixed and corrupted with the inventions of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>When a people turn to God by repentance, and he returns to them in mercy, he will give unto them one name,</hi> (that is) <hi>he will free them from all ſuperſtitious and humane mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his worſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In opening whereof I ſhall ſhow two things: firſt that in all ages it hath been the main labour of Satan and all the enemies of the Church, when they could not root out the worſhip of God wholly, then to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſimplicity of it by humane inventions, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſuperſtitious mixtures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that when they turn unto God, and God unto them, he will free them from all theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the main aim hath been a mixed Religion, contrary to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, ſo that if they cannot ſowe wholly tares, yet there ſhall be <hi>tares ſown amongſt the wheat;</hi> this hath been alwaies the practice of <hi>the envious man, Mat.</hi> 13.28. this will appear if we look into the ſeveral ages of the Church, and we ſhall find that the ſame plot hath been alwaies on foot.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, look upon the Church of God in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there Satan introduced a mixture; they worſhiped indeed the true God, as appeared in the Idolatry of the

                  <p>Yet when God had given them this warning, when they were come into <hi>Canaan</hi> they were mixed among the Heathen, and learned their waies, and worſhipped their Idols, which proved a ſnare unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.36. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> fled into <hi>Egypt</hi> from the face of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and there he learned the Idolatry of the Calves: and when he came to the Crown this was the Religion, and the way of worſhip, that he had a deſire for Politick ends to ſet up; but yet he would have it to come as neer to the worſhip of God at Jeruſalem as poſſibly he might: they had their Temple, Altar, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, every whit as chargable, and in humane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as rational as that at Jeruſalem; only there muſt be a mixture of ſomething he had deviſed out of his own

                  </p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Ahab</hi> did not wholly caſt off the worſhip God, but yet he muſt have his mixture alſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>he joyned unto the Calves the worſhip of</hi> Baal <hi>which was yet more hateful,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.31,32. King <hi>Ahaz</hi> did not who ly caſt off the worſhip of God, yet he brought from <hi>Damaſcus</hi> a new faſhioned Altar, which it ſeemed that King was much taken with, and the pattern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſent before hand unto <hi>Vriah</hi> the Prieſt to provide him the like againſt the Kings return, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.10,11. And as we ſay where God hath his Church, the Devil hath his Chappel; ſo where the Devil hath his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel he ſhall ſeldom want a Chaplain; he did provide him the Altar againſt the King came home: So in the times of the Prophets there was ſtill a mixture aimed at, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.4,5. there were ſome that did <hi>ſwear by God and by Malcome alſo:</hi> and thus in the daies of <hi>Ioſiah</hi> there was a great reformation in matters of Religion, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip in publick was much ſuppreſſed, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. Yet <hi>there was a remnant of Baal</hi> yet remaining, which is conceived not to be expreſt ſo much in outward pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by reaſon of his reſtraint of authority, but it was much in the hearts of the people, there being in them ſtill a proneſs unto that kind of Idolatry, that for many years formerly the Land had been infected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:

                     <hi>incaluit</hi> (that is) men more zealous and hot then ordinary for thoſe Idolatrous worſhips, men that did further and promote it with all their power; and if there be a remnant of <hi>Baal</hi> anywhere, a thouſand to one but there will be found <hi>Chemarims</hi> alſo, men very hot and zealous to advance and encreaſe it.</p>
                  <p>In the Primitive times we know there was a mixture of the <hi>Bondage of the Law</hi> with <hi>the liberty of the Goſpel.</hi> Of legal Ceremonies, and Evangelical Ordinances: a compoſition of Iudaiſm, and Chriſtianity; becauſe they ſaw there was a queſtion, they thought to take in both for ſurety as the ſafeſt way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">After this Popery came into the world, and that is meerly a mixture, a medly in their worſhip, a mixture of Gods Ordinances, and carnal and heatheniſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions: the Pope a mixture of a Prince and a Prieſt: their Maſs a mixture of a Ceremony and a Sacrament: their Canons a mixture partly out of the Word of God, and partly from their own traditions: and to ſhew that they love the mid-way in all theſe, their Purgatory a middle place between Heaven and Hell.</q>

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:168372:6"/> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16. <hi>that do receive the mark of the Beaſt;</hi> a mark I conceive to be an expreſſion taken either from a ſervant or a ſouldier, who by ſome badge or cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance are known to what Maſter or Captain they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; for as Chriſt will have <hi>his Church ſealed, Rev.</hi> 7.3. ſo will Antichriſt have his ſervants mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>And this mark the text tels us is double, <hi>in the right hand, and in the forehead:</hi> the one notes an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the other an earneſt contention to promote the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the fore-head; it is an open profeſſion either in words or practiſe, when men either practiſe it, or praiſe it: when men praiſe their feaſts, keep their faſts, honour their Saints, ſet up their images, commend their Crucifixes, love their Ornaments, their Copes, their Tapers, chooſe their names of Prieſts, and Altars <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is as plain hereby as if it were written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, to whom they do belong, and it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that a mixture, a middle way they deſire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A mark in the right hand ſets forth an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt contention in the cauſe of the beaſt, the right hand being the Inſtrument of action, and that wherein a mans main ſtrength lyeth; and ſo Antichriſt hath his Merchants, his Factors and Agents in moſt parts of the world, that ſtrive to the utmoſt of their parts and power in many things, if not in all, to advance the worſhip of the beaſt, and to engage men in their quarrel. So that in all ages there hath been a mixture; for Satan would have a Religion like unto <hi>Nebuchadnezars Image;</hi> he cares not though the head be of Gold, and the breaſt of Silver, ſo long as the other parts be either of braſs, or elſe partly of Iron and partly clay.</p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:168372:6"/>
                  <p>Now what hath been the cauſe of theſe mixtures in all ages? they are two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the Miniſtery: and,</p>
                  <p>Secondly the people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>an unclean ſpirit working in the Prophets;</hi> that is given as one reaſon when the Lord will cleanſe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and take away the cauſes of their pollution he ſaith, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.2. <hi>he will cauſe the Prophet and the unclean ſpirit to paſs out of the Land:</hi> (that is) the unclean ſpirit that works in the Prophets, for the truth is there is a ſpirit of uncleanneſs and prophaneſs is gone forth into the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, horrible pride in all thoſe in whom this ſpirit of uncleanneſs doth take place; <hi>for vain man would be wiſe, Iob</hi> 11.12. and he affects a ſhew of wiſdom in nothing ſo much as in matters of Religion, either in the Doctrine or the worſhip of God; and this is made a ſpecial cauſe of all humane mixtures, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>being vainly puft up by their fleſhly minds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a vehement deſire that ſome men have ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from this pride to win Proſelytes unto themſelves, that all men may be of their mind, after their garb in all things; they <hi>would have you circumciſed, that they may glory in your fleſh: ut multitudine ſequacium ſeſe efferant,</hi> that they may pleaſe themſelves in this, how many they have brought about, and how many Diſciples they have drawn after them, that become their admirers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, horrible hypocriſie, when men are <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres within,</hi> yet they deſire outwardly to appear <hi>paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> who having no power of godlineſs within, yet by new inventions would fain bear the world in hand, that ſurely they are men of a higher ſtrain for matters of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:168372:7"/> Religion then ordinary, whereof their zeal for <hi>a little bodily exerciſe</hi> and outward complement muſt be the great witneſs to the world; and this Chriſt chargeth upon the Phariſees as a ſpecial cauſe of all that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and compoſition that was in the Church of God amongſt them, as we ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13,14.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, worldly wiſdom, politick reſpects, and fleſhly ends; what moved <hi>Ieroeobam</hi> to ſet up the Calves, or <hi>Iehu</hi> to retain them, but becauſe it ſuited better with their policy, and earthly aims and purpoſes, then the purity of Gods worſhip would ever have done; for when men come to this, to <hi>count gain godlineſs,</hi> then that will be the beſt Religion, or the beſt way of worſhip, and thoſe the moſt decent ceremonies that will but further their worldly ends.</p>
                  <p>So ſometimes a correſpondency with forraign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of another Religion: So <hi>Ahaz</hi> that he might keep his correſpondency with forraign powers, with <hi>Tiglah Pelezer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he muſt have the faſhion abroad alſo, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.11,12. outward references have many times a great influence into the matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and laſtly, there are four ſins which are in a eſpecial manner incident unto the Prophets, and the great cauſes thereof are, Ignorance, Idleneſs, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cowardize.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ignorance; that is given as a ſpecial cauſe of many humane inventions amongſt the Phariſees; <hi>thou blind Phariſee, Mat.</hi> 23.26. And the Church of <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> many well-meaning men were deluded becauſe they knew not the depth of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. many men are deluded becauſe they ſee not the evil that is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the Apoſtle tels us of Popery, that it is <hi>a myſterie of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:168372:7"/> iniquity,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Iniquitas, ſed myſtica, pietatis &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitatis nomine palliata:</hi> repreſented unto men under the names both of piety and loyalty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Idleneſs and careleſneſs in matters of this nature, ſo that if men can enjoy their liberty, live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and richly, for the purity of Gods worſhip it matters not ſo much; that is given as the cauſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.24,25. <hi>While men ſlept the enemy came and ſowed tares.</hi> In moſt ages there have been ſome ſecure and quiet times of the Church; when the Prophets have taken their eaſe, and <hi>a ſpirit of ſlumber hath come upon them,</hi> and then is the time to vent and ſet forth the inventions of men, and ſo by little and little, <hi>pedetentim, uſu ipſo &amp; tacita Doctorum approbatione coepit eſſe in precio, hac aeſtimatione ſenſim ſine ſenſu creſcente.</hi> As a Jeſuite ſpeaks of ſome things in Popery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Covetouſneſs, a deſire of raiſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the world, and to ſet themſelves in a way of preferment: and when men ſee there is no other way to riſe, then they reſolve to yield unto this: ſo it was with them of the <hi>Conciſion,</hi> who brought ſuch a Mixture, and cauſed ſuch a rent in the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. it was becauſe <hi>their God was their belly, and they minded earthly things:</hi> So that if there be a <hi>Diotrephes that loves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,</hi> he muſt and will have both the Dictates and Inventions of men as well as <hi>their perſons in admiration for advantage ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Cowardize, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.12. they found out a middle way to mix the bondage of the Law with the liberty of the Goſpel, <hi>that they might not ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the croſs of Chriſt,</hi> but that they might be well thought of on both ſides. <hi>Ieroboham</hi> ſet up Idolatry in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and <hi>an old Prophet of the Lord dwelt there,</hi> yet
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:168372:8"/> ſuch was his Cowardize, that it ſeems he had nothing to ſay againſt it, but that the Lord muſt ſend a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from <hi>Judah</hi> to reprove him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. and the truth is, had not the Miniſters been in many ages a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of ſpiritual cowards, they had never had ſo many inventions impoſed upon them as they have had.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are alſo many cauſes in the people; but I will only inſiſt upon this one becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the Doctrine of the Goſpel in the purity, nor <hi>the worſhip of God in the love of it;</hi> and therefore the Lord in Juſtice <hi>gives them up unto an efficacy of deceit,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10,11. They are ready to receive any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine without <hi>trying the ſpirits,</hi> and to yield unto any command willingly, <hi>walk after the Commandment, Hoſ.</hi> 5.11. they are for the moſt part a lump fit to receive any leaven; <hi>the Prophets prophecy falſly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple love to have it ſo, Ier.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> for a pompous Religion, that conſiſts much in outward ſhews, and that which abounds moſt in <hi>bodily exerciſe,</hi> is a thing that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well-pleaſing unto men, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.5. and uſually when men forſake the rule, then they look more at what will pleaſe them, then what will pleaſe God: <hi>this liketh you O houſe of Iſrael:</hi> and this was all they looked at therein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when God turns unto a people in mercy, and they return unto him, he will free them from all this ſuperſtition or idolatrous mixtures, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>I will reſtore unto them a pure language:</hi> which place being compared with that, <hi>Iſa</hi> 19.18. <hi>They ſhall all ſpeak the language of Canaan:</hi> Language there notes <hi>conſenſum cum populo Dei in fide &amp; cultu: reſtoring a pure language,</hi> may ſignifie purity both in Doctrine and Worſhip: they
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:168372:8"/> ſhall ſpeak no more partly <hi>the language of Canaan, and partly of Aſhdod,</hi> as in times paſt: but <hi>the pure language of Canaan:</hi> in Judgement <hi>I will make them one Nation upon the Mountains of Iſrael, and they ſhall defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no more with their Idols and their deteſtable things, and from all your Idols I will cleanſe you,</hi> Ezek. 37.2,3. <hi>And I will give unto them one heart and one way, that they ſhall fear me for ever, Ier.</hi> 32.39.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why the Lord will take away theſe mixtures when he returns, are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe uſually theſe are the greateſt and the moſt provoking ſins of a Nation, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.15. <hi>all their wickedneſs is in Gilgal;</hi> this was antiently the place of worſhip, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.12. and there they did now worſhip God according to their own devices; the Prophet tels them, where they did think to pleaſe God, it was the greateſt tranſgreſſion that they did commit; for ſo <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the particle</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is to be taken <hi>pro ſummo,</hi> in all their thefts, adulteries, drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they did not all of them provoke the Lord, ſo much as that they did worſhip him according to their own inventions <hi>in Gilgal. Deo ſerviendum eſt non ex arbitrio ſed ex imperio:</hi> There is nothing to be done but by rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16 now where the creature ſhall take ſo much upon himſelf as to ſet his wiſdom above the wiſdom of God, and <hi>ſet his thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold beſide the threſhold of the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 43.8. it is a provoking ſin that the Lord cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe this is a ſpecial cauſe why God departs from any people; now the Lord will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in mercy unleſs the cauſe be taken away that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to depart; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.7. every humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impoſed as neceſſary to the ſervice of God, is <hi>an
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:168372:9"/> Image of jealouſie, and the aim of it is to provoke the Lord to go far from his Sanctuary:</hi> it is <hi>finis operis,</hi> though not <hi>operantis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe of all Judgements upon a people, this is the greateſt; and therefore when the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns unto them in mercy he muſt take away theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>I gave them up to walk in their own counſels,</hi> it is ſpoken as of the greateſt Judgement could befall them: and ſo it is for a man to be a rule to himſelf; for he that is his own rule, muſt needs be his own end, and he that is his own end, muſt needs be his own God; and therefore it is a ſpeech of the greateſt diſpleaſure, he hath made unto himſelf Altars to ſin, therefore Altars ſhall be unto him to ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when God doth return unto a people in mercy, he doth intend <hi>to delight in them, and rejoyce over them to do them good,</hi> and that he can never do in any ſervice that they perform, until worſhip be purged from humane mixtures, <hi>Mal</hi> 3.3,4. <hi>When he hath ſat in his Church as a refiner,</hi> and hath purged his worſhip, <hi>then ſhall the ſacrifices of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be pleaſant unto the Lord as in the daies of old:</hi> then, but not till then.</p>

                  <p>Let this teach every one of us a double duty. Firſt, hate all idolatrous and ſuperſtitious mixtures in Gods worſhip whatſoever. Secondly, beware of them. Firſt, hate them as being the thing that <hi>cauſeth the Lord to go far from his Sanctuary: to be unto his people as a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man that tarries but for a night:</hi> groan under them as burdens, that ſo the Lord may return unto his people in mercy, and reſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> unto his Church <hi>a pure
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:168372:9"/> language;</hi> that they may no longer <hi>halt between two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;</hi> no more <hi>ſwear by God and by Malcome;</hi> but that he may reſtore to us one heart and one way.</p>
                  <p>To move your hatred againſt it; conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of all kinds of ſin this is moſt defiling: <hi>thou defiledſt thy ſelf with thy Idols, Ezek.</hi> 22.4. Now what is defilement or filthineſs? it is, ſaith <hi>Aquinas, Carentia nitoris quem ex gratia habemus:</hi> indeed all ſin ſtains and blemiſheth the beauty of the ſoul, but this ſin above others. And if we obſerve the Scripture, we ſhall ſee that they have been men of moſt corrupt ſpirits, and the moſt profligated conſciences that have been moſt ſet upon humane inventions in the things of God: take the Phariſees for an inſtance; and indeed it is Juſt with God, that they that will find out waies of worſhip for God to be unto themſelves means of ſanctification, that thoſe ſhould prove in juſt Judgement a means of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is moſt inflaming: <hi>they have inflamed themſelves with their Idols under every green tree, Iſa.</hi> 57.5. they are ſaid to be for this cauſe, <hi>mad upon their Idols, Ier.</hi> 50.38. Now in madneſs there are two things: <hi>furor,</hi> and <hi>amentia;</hi> here is both; firſt all ſoundneſs of mind is taken away, that a man cannot ſay, <hi>Is there a not a lye in my right hand?</hi> Secondly, it carries the whole man with fury after it, ſo that none more violent in their perſecutions then ſuch men are who deſire or have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced for Doctrines the conceits of men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is no ſin wherein men do manifeſt more folly; <hi>ſtriving to ſhew themſelves wiſe they become fools, Rom.</hi> 1.21. for how highly ſoever men eſteem of humane contributions in Gods worſhip: yet in Gods account they are no better then playes, and mimical
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:168372:10"/> dancings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.6. we know it was that which they intended for a Religious worſhip; but being in a way of their own deviſing, the Lord calls it <hi>play,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. renders it: So that they were but childiſh carriages, <hi>antiqui geſtus,</hi> neither ſuitable to the holineſs of God nor the Majeſty of his Ordinances; only fit to pleaſe children and no more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, No ſin ripens Judgement more, nor ripens a people more for Judgement. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Thou haſt defiled thy ſelf with thy Idols, thou haſt cauſed thy daies to draw neer, thou art come even unto thy years.</hi> This provoked the Lord <hi>to break both the ſtaff of beauty, and of bands,</hi> with which he fed his people, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.7. the ſtaff of beauty, that excellent order of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that was amongſt them, was now turned into confuſion: and the ſtaff of bonds of mutual love and amity that was amongſt them, turned to diviſion.

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is an endleſs ſin: wherein a man knows not where to ſtay, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.1. <hi>According to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his fruit, he increaſed his Altars, and according to the good neſs of his land, he hath made unto himſelf good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Images:</hi> as God bleſſed them in their eſtates, ſo they began to bethink themſelves of a more pompous way of Religion; for if any mans fancy may be a rule, then may one mans as well as anothers, and ſo a man ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know where to ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, beware of it alſo; for ſeeing it hath been a ſin in ſo many ages of the Church, it ſeems a mans
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:168372:10"/> nature is exceeding prone to it; therefore take heed you be not inſnared by it: <hi>little children keep your ſelves from Idols: amen,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> and you have great cauſe to take heed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they are brought in under beautiful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; <hi>the myſterie Babylon gives the wine of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a golden cup, Rev.</hi> 17.4. and in this ſhe is truly. <hi>a Harlot,</hi> her hands are ſnares and bands: ſhe is skilful to allure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, take the more heed becauſe they come not in all at once, but by degrees they creep in, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which properly ſignifies deceit at dice, ſo that there is not ſo much cheating and jugling in the moſt deceitful ſport, as there is uſed by them that in this kind <hi>lie in wait to deceive. Hoſ.</hi> 7.6. it was the way that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had to bring in his Idolatry into this ſtate.; his deſires and purpoſes were <hi>as hot as an oven;</hi> but the people were a great lump, and they could not be preſently leavened; and therefore he ſends forth his Agents into the ſeveral parts of his Kingdom, and they did ſeek to leaven the people, and in the mean time <hi>the Baker ſlept and ceaſed from raiſing:</hi> the people were not leavened by and by, nor fitted to receive ſuch corrupt worſhip, and therefore he did ſtay a while till it might be done.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take heed of it: for if it once begin, it will ſtrangely encreaſe: if one that goes before do bring in ſome, there be thoſe that come after that will add to the plot: as when Popery was ſet up, we know one Pope
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:168372:11"/> added ſomething, and another ſomething more, till at laſt they made up that patched Religion. If <hi>Ieroboam bring in the calves, its a thouſand to one but afterwards Omri and Ahab ſhall ſet up the worſhip of Baal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a great diſhonour to a Congregation; for it makes all the worſhip of God unfruitful; <hi>for in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, Mat.</hi> 15.9. nay it makes them ſinful, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.4. <hi>Go up to</hi> Bethel <hi>and tranſgreſs,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Fifthly, they will ſurely eat out all the heart of the worſhip of God in time. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.14,15. when <hi>Ahaz</hi> had ſet up a new faſhioned Altar, he commande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Laſtly, this will ſtand a man in no ſtead in time to come; its ſpoken with ſome deriſion, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Oh Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria thy calf hath caſt thee off:</hi> when the captivity came, the Lord tells them that, becauſe they were very confident that they ſhould be delivered: but now it ſeems the calf hath caſt you off. <hi>Canaan</hi> was the Lords Land, and he gave it to you, and to your Fathers for an inheritance: but as ſoon as you caſt off God, it is no wonder if the Calf caſt off you, and caſt you

                  <p>Seeing the words are a promiſe that there <hi>ſhall be one God and one name,</hi> conſider, promiſes are objects of faith, grounds of hope, and rules of prayer: and by theſe things men live, and in this is the life of our ſpirits, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38,16. that is, on this we reſt, in theſe we hope, and according unto theſe we pray: and in this doth the life of a mans ſpirit mainly conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then look upon this particular promiſe as an object of faith; and concerning it we muſt exerciſe theſe four ſeveral acts of faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let thy faith ſound the depth of this promiſe; for there be <hi>treaſures</hi> in the word, and they lie not above ground, they muſt <hi>be digged for, Prov.</hi> 2.4 and they be not the ſmalleſt to be had in the promiſes; what doth God here promiſe? ſimplicity and ſincerity, in whatever concerns his worſhip and ſervice; for whatever is mixed departs from unity: now of humane mixtures I find in Scripture three ſorts, and unto them all I conceive this promiſe reaches: ſo our faith muſt look upon it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in Doctrine, mixing the truth of God with falſe gloſſes, and corrupt interpretations, neither agreeing to the wiſdom, majeſty, or mind of the Holy-Ghoſt, and this is the mixture here ſpoken of, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.28. <hi>what is the chaff to the wheat?</hi> and yet if many Sermons were winnowed, though the chaff is nothing to the wheat, yet it might haply prove more then the wheat.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in worſhip; Acts in the worſhip of God, that have no other ground but the will of man, that is the mixture the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. they did
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:168372:12"/> worſhip the true God, and they did in many things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe acts which he required, but they mixed ſome acts out of their own will, which God never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither came it into his heart, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.31.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in Diſcipline a mixture of the Ordinances of God, and of the Commandments of men, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turning the power they have from God againſt them for whoſe good and preſervation it was mainly given; the edge of the ſword againſt the watch-man, <hi>Ier.</hi> 36.5. <hi>he was ſhut up:</hi> it was not in priſon, for he fled and hid himſelf, and therefore it is conceived to be ſpoken of excommunication: and ſo they <hi>ſlay the witneſſes:</hi> which cannot be underſtood litterally of kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as men, but Metaphorically killing them as witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. If there be a rotten member to be cut off, they ſtrike with the back of the ſword; but if a godly man have but a hair to be paired off, they turn the edge and ſtrike a full blow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo vvhen men mix the Ordinances of God with their ovvn corrupt ends, and order all things in matter of Government ſo as it ſhall beſt ſerve to advance their worldly ends, colour over acts of policy vvith pretences of piety: <hi>Say it is Corban,</hi> for their ovvn advantage ſake, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.11. let thy faith engage thee to lay hold on the promiſe in all this, and expect to be delivered from them all, that in every one of theſe reſpects Gods name may be one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, put forth an act of reliance, affiance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbence, or vvhatever elſe doth expreſs an act of an humble and believing ſoul, caſting himſelf upon a promiſe to obtain it: cleave to the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.13. leave thy ſelf vvith the promiſe: for that is the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>the poor have themſelves with thee.</hi> Pſa. 10,14 <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:168372:12"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſhut thy eyes againſt all difficulties, ſtagger not at the unlikelineſs of the means: he that ſhould look upon the Iſraelites at their diviſion, and ſee how much diviſion and how much Idolatry there was amongſt them, and that of all the Nations round about (but yet the Lord hath ſaid it, and it ſhall be accompliſhed in his ſeaſon) he that ſhall obſerve how exceedingly a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Religion pleaſeth them, and how much they are taken with humane additions in Gods ſervice, how firmly it is rooted and with what power it is backed, he will be ready to ſay, <hi>if God ſhould create windows in heaven,</hi> this could not be: but know, though there were mountains in this way of his people, yet this could not hinder the accompliſhment of a promiſe; <hi>Who art thou O great mountain? before</hi> Zerubabel <hi>thou ſhalt become a plain, Zach.</hi> 4.6,7. nay and theſe mountains faith doth often remove and make them become a plain.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, wait for the performance of it in Gods due time. <hi>Act</hi> 1.4. <hi>rejoyce for the promiſe of the Father,</hi> though it may haply by ſin be delayed. God brought his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the borders of the Land of promiſe, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the good Land, and yet by their unthankful walking, they were led back again fourty years in the wilderneſs; but however, if it tarry, rejocye for it: <hi>for it will ſpeak, and it will not lye, it will come and it will not tarry, Hab.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let it be unto thee alſo a ground of hope: the object of hope is good things to come; and that which is grounded upon the promiſe is <hi>lively hope that never makes aſhamed;</hi> let there be an holy, an earneſt expectation and groaning for it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <pb n="488" facs="tcp:168372:13"/>
                  <p>And to ſtir up your hope, conſider firſt, it will be a means to allay your preſent grief; to ſee men uſurpe the Throne of God, and talk of ſitting immediately in the conſciences, and to wring thoſe tender wards of conſcience that is as ſoon ſpoyled as a Ship caſt away, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. to hear the word of God (as preached) ſet forth by the unnouriſhing vapours of humane wit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a grief to a good heart; ſo to ſee the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God pure in themſelves, to be ſet out with the dreſſings and blandiſhments of the inventions of men, like a wall of a marble with a roof of ſtraw; to ſee people <hi>turned away with every wind of Doctrine;</hi> and when Miniſters ſhall have cauſe to complain that have preached long in a place, <note place="margin">P. Martyr</note> as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> did at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when he heard in <hi>Oxford</hi> a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge bell ring to Maſs &amp; the Students flocking there a pace, <hi>Haec una notula omnem meam doctrinam evertit:</hi> this bell rings a paſſing peal to all my Lectures, to all my Sermons: to that man to whom the Ordinances in their purity be dearer then his life, it cannot but be a great grief; as the contrary cannot but be a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy when he ſhall conſider that the time will come when <hi>the Kingdom ſhall be the Lords,</hi> and men ſhall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the purity of his worſhip no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hereby the Ordinances ſhall be ſet up in their glory, and they are ſurely the glory of a Nation whereſoever they are, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4: <hi>ult.</hi> To ſee <hi>Romam in flore,</hi> that is one of St. <hi>Auſtines</hi> wiſhes; how much more doth a good heart deſire to ſee <hi>Eccleſiam in flore,</hi> that God may beautifie the houſe of his glory? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, then ſhall his people more fully enjoy the preſence of God in his Ordinances; for when the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is purged, <hi>the glory of the Lord will fill the houſe,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:168372:13"/> Ezek.</hi> 43.1,2. <hi>and the name of the City ſhall be</hi> Jehovah Shammah, <hi>the Lord is there, Ezek.</hi> 48. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hereby the conſciences of Gods people ſhall be freed from many an unneceſſary burthen; now ye ſhould <hi>deſire the peace of Jeruſalem; they ſhall proſper that love it, Pſal.</hi> 1,22 6. ſuppoſe your conſciences be not touched; what if they be no burthens upon you; yet where is the ſpirit that ſaid, <hi>who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let it be a rule of prayer, for the promiſe is the only rule of what we can ask in faith, and prayer the only ground of what we can expect with comfort, and therefore let thy heart ſay Amen unto this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>be it unto thy ſervant according to thy word,</hi> Luke 1.38.</p>
                  <p>And to ſtir you up to it, conſider firſt the means by which God will do it, and they be all deſirable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he hath promiſed <hi>to take away the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of the Land:</hi> for if the unclean man were taken away, new would ariſe, therefore the promiſe is to take away the unclean ſpirit, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he will take off the hearts of his people from theſe mixtures, that <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to do any more with Idols? Hoſ.</hi> 14.18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he will root out all theſe Idolatrous ſpirits amongſt us, that will not be reclaimed; they that purifie themſelves in gardens ſhall be conſumed when God comes to purifie his Church, <hi>Iſa. ult.</hi> 17. <hi>there ſhall be no Canaanite in the Land any more for ever, Zach.</hi> 14 <hi>ult.</hi> and when they are cut off, no more of his name ſhall be ſown, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to move you to it, you have Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.6. <hi>Ye that are the Lords remembrancers,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:168372:14"/> keep not ſilence;</hi>

                     <hi>the Lords recorders:</hi> and a main thing that the people of God do record, is the promiſes which as yet remain unaccompliſhed unto the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we have a concurrence of all the prayers of the Church of God that have gone before us; for the prayers of the Church be like the acts of a State, they dye not with the man that made them; for they are made unto an eternal God, grounded upon an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs, offered by an eternal ſpirit, and therefore they are eternally acceptable, and of an eternal efficacy; in after ages <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.8. took effect upon <hi>Judas, Act.</hi> 1.2. therefore as we muſt preach for after ages as the Prophets did, and the Apoſtles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon their labours, ſo muſt we pray for after ages, and be content that other men in time to come ſhall reap the benefit of our prayers.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God hath begun already, and now we have great cauſe to be earneſt with him to go on with it; <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom.</note> for he hath ſaid, <hi>ſhall I bring to the birth, and ſhall I not bring forth? Iſa.</hi> 60.9. Experiences of former mercies are a ſpecial pledge of future, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 74.14. <hi>he ſmote the head of Leviathan in the waters: and gave him to be meat to his people inhabiting the wilderneſs;</hi> it is ſpoken of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> army which God deſtroyed in the red Sea; that is, the deſtruction of the Egyptians was a pledge to him of the accompliſhment of the mercy that God had promiſed to caſt the <hi>Canaanite</hi> out of the promiſed Land, and to give them poſſeſſion of it; many hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips they were to paſs through in the wilderneſs; but God gave them this mercy as food, not to their bodies, but food to their faith, while they were in the wilderneſs: therefore thoſe former great and glorious promiſes
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:168372:14"/> were accompliſhed. So that former mercies are food that God gives unto the faith of his people to feed upon till he hath perfectly accompliſhed whatever he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto his Church</p>
                  <p>Let no man ſay, who ſhall live when God doth this? but be ſure, for thy time, have a ſtock going in the Churches ſhip; for <hi>there is no knowledge, nor work, nor labour in the grave where thou art going:</hi> therefore ſow thy ſeed, and if the harveſt come not in thy time, yet thou ſhalt be no loſer; for in glory God will reward thee according to the fruits of thy doing, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.10. the Lord tells thee, <hi>Go thy way</hi> Daniel, <hi>thou ſhalt reſt and ſtand up in thy lot in the end of thy dayes, Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> comfort and encourage one another with theſe words.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt the wiſdom of God.</hi> So <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. <hi>I was by him as one brought up with him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Grace which is the only wiſdom in a man, and ſo <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom:</hi> or <hi>caput,</hi> the chief and the principal part of it: but it is only in the latter of theſe ſenſes that I ſhall ſpeak to at this time.</p>
               <div n="1" type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>that grace only is true wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>that this wiſdom is the principal thing:</hi> which hath more excellency in it then all things elſe in the world: there is in it a ſuperlative and a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency above all excellencies in the world.</p>
                  <p>And that grace only is the true wiſdom, this I ſhall clear to you theſe two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord (who is only wiſe) he counts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wiſdom but goldineſs, and this he doth every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſtile <hi>wiſdom:</hi> there is a great enquiry and ſearch amongſt all the creatures where wiſdom is to be found: <hi>men know not the price of it, neither is it to be found in the Land of the living:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 28. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> (that is) amongſt all the creatures,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:168372:17"/> and in all the ſtudies of them; <hi>the depth ſaith it is not in me,</hi> &amp;c. it cannot be gotten for gold, <hi>it cannot be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the gold of</hi> Ophir, <hi>with the precious Onyx or the Saphyre,</hi> &amp;c. and yet <hi>the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom</hi> unto men, and <hi>to depart from evil, that is underſtanding, Pſal.</hi> 90.12. <hi>teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom, &amp;c.</hi> (that is) in Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhortneſs of them, we may get grace to our ſelves, which will be immortal, and ſtand by us when all the creatures both in heaven and earth ſhall fail and forſake us, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37. where grace expreſſed in the holy converſation of Chriſt and <hi>John,</hi> is called wiſdom; <hi>wiſdom is juſtified of all her children,</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17. <hi>ſouls</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>converted to the wiſdom of the juſt,</hi> &amp;c and therefore a godly man only is called <hi>the man of wiſdom, Micha</hi> 6.9. therefore in Gods account grace only is wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in Gods account all things is folly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace; and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> throughout this Book, and ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 14.1. the wicked men are the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh men: <hi>the fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God:</hi> the wicked man and the fool are <hi>Synonoma's,</hi> and expreſs the ſame thing: an unholy man, is a marvellous unwiſe man. Take a view of that which hath the greateſt ſhew of wiſdom, and the greateſt name of wiſdom in the world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, all humane knowledge without grace it is but folly; the He athen moſt of them were the greateſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts and Philoſophers in the world, thoſe that moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the ſecrets of nature, and had brought all humane learning unto the greateſt height, as in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> which were Univerſities and places far more famous then any other for knowledge, tongues,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:168372:17"/> and all abilities, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>God hath made fooliſh the wiſdom of the wiſe</hi> (that is) made it manifeſt ſo to be, and, <hi>whileſt they profeſt themſelves wiſe, they became fools;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.22.</note> but they had not the knowledge of the Scriptures, and therefore their knowledge might well be folly: but for the Jews and their Rabbies, they had great knowledge in the Scripture and in divine myſteries; ſurely their knowledge was wiſdom: Chriſt ſpeaks it to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, the moſt learned amongſt them all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.17. <hi>ye fools and blind,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that if a man had all natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the higheſt pitch that ever was attained, a ſharp wit, a piercing apprehenſion, a ſolid judgement, a firm and a tenacious memory, and theſe acted and hightened by induſtry, and Art, the help of tongues, and the greateſt improvement of reading, and exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without a principle of grace put into the heart to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and enliven a man, all this would be but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and never be counted wiſdom in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, take the greateſt Statiſt and Polititian the world, which hath alſo a great ſhew and name for wiſdom; let a man be acquainted with the Laws of all States, let him be able by experience and obſervation, to judge of the managing of all affairs, let him ſit at the ſtern of the State, and let him with never ſo great dexterity manage all the affairs of it, and let his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be as that of <hi>Achitophel as an Angel of God, and as an Oracle of God;</hi> yet without a principle of grace in the ſoul, <hi>the wiſdom of this world is fooliſhneſs with God, and he takes the wiſe in their own craftineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. and their own policies prove their own ſnares, they are taken in their own nets.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take the greateſt men in the world, and they
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:168372:18"/> are <hi>wiſe in their own conceits, Prov.</hi> 28.11. that they can ſo manage their affairs as to get an eſtate, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the face and glory of the times, raiſe their Bayes, and mount up all the ſtairs of authority and honour, and make haſt to be great, but yet without the power of godlineſs, <hi>Lu.</hi> 12.20. it is but, <hi>Thou fool this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, come to the civil men of the world, and they are the worlds Saints, that can ſo order themſelves in the profeſſion of Religion, that they can keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>unſpotted of the world,</hi> and be eſteemed <hi>Saints in their generation,</hi> and yet can with wiſdom avoid thoſe dangerous waies of extremity that godly men do walk in, as ſavouring of too much niceneſs and preciſeneſs, and they can be counted honeſt men and Saints, yet without the power of grace in their hearts, they are but <hi>fooliſh Virgins, Mat.</hi> 25.1. and all the former blaze that they made with the <hi>oyl in their lamps,</hi> it was but their folly, and no wiſdom in Gods account.</p>
                  <p>So that in the Judgement of the great God, only <hi>the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom:</hi> and the <hi>knowledge of the holy, that is underſtanding:</hi> there is nothing wiſdom but godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>And this will appear by theſe rules of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wiſdom acts by the higheſt principles: that is the firſt thing wherein a mans folly in a ſtate of ſin is ſeen, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. <hi>having their underſtanding darkned:</hi> which is the ſeat of principles; and according to a mans principles, which are the rules of his actions, ſuch they are: for <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Wiſdom is profitable to direct:</hi> it gives a man a right rule to vvalk by every man is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the principles by vvhich he vvalks: lay but
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:168372:18"/> theſe two principles in a mans heart. Firſt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only true Church. Secondly, that this Church cannot err, and he is immediately a Papiſt though he act not many of their fooleries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So lay but theſe principles.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that ſin is no ſuch great evil as men are told it is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it be a great evil, yet men think God is merciful, he is not ſo ſtrict and ſevere as men ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if God be ſo ſtrict, yet it is long before the day of Judgement, and therefore it will be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man comes to an account, and this will make a man a prophane man immediately, and <hi>to pour out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto all evil with greedineſs.</hi> So lay but theſe two principles;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that every man is to love himſelf beſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I am not my brothers keeper:</hi> it is nothing to me what other men do, or what they ſuffer; and this will lay the foundation of all manner of cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now the high and excellent principles that godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs laies in the ſoul, are ſuch as theſe; Ile name five to you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the chief beauty of the creature is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, every man is in value as much as his ſoul is worth, and no more; <hi>the heart of the wicked is little worth: Prov.</hi> beauty is vain, but <hi>a woman that fears the Lord ſhe ſhall be praiſed; the Kings daughter is all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the happineſs of the creature conſiſts in communion with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. if a man had fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the wiſeſt men of the world, yet it would not
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:168372:19"/> content him; if this be his principle, that his felictty lies in Communion with God, <hi>One day in thy houſe,</hi> ſaith ſuch a ſoul, <hi>is better then a thouſand years elſe-where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that ſin is the greateſt evil in the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. it is filthineſs it ſelf, <hi>the excrement of naughtineſs: ſinful ſin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that it is better to ſuffer then to ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. <hi>ſuffering is but a light affliction</hi> in compariſon of ſin, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>the things that are ſeen are but temporal, the things that are not ſeen are eternal,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. ſuch a man ſees <hi>the faſhion of the world ſtill paſsing away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>One of theſe principles now will change the man, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. it is by <hi>the word ingrafted in the heart,</hi> that the ſeed of grace appears; the heart brings forth fruit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principle that is put into it: all men judge according to the principles that are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now there are lower principles by which the moſt of men are acted, as the courſe of the world, the example of the multitude, the great ones, the Traditions of the Fathers, and the common principles that go abroad amongſt men, and according unto theſe, men Judge, and walk, and are acted in all their waies: this is the firſt property of a wiſe man, he lives by wiſe and high principles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wiſdom is ſeen in a right Judgement of all things: to conceive of things as they are, and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right ſentence upon them all.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he Judges good things to come, to tranſcend all the good things in this life: <hi>better then all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin that are preſent, Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. it
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:168372:19"/> is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, he had reſpect unto the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: pleaſures at Gods right hand for evermore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he Judges men miſerable that have all the jollities and excellencies of the world in reſpect of the miſeries to come, which is the portion of all the fools in the world, that do not <hi>buy this pearl of great price: Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl, for you have received your conſolation;</hi> and, <hi>Son, remember that in thy life time thou receivedſt thy good things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it will make a man to judge aright of all the circumſtances of mens actions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.5. <hi>he that gathers in ſummer is a wiſe ſon:</hi> Mat. 25.3. <hi>the fooliſh Virgins come to buy when it is too late,</hi> Luk. 19.42. Eccl. 8.5. <hi>a wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he Judges aright of the iſſues and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of all things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>a wiſe man fore-ſees the evil, and hideth himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. he knows, <hi>the wicked are made for the day of wrath:</hi> and though <hi>they flouriſh now like a green Bay-tree:</hi> yet <hi>what will they do in the end thereof, Deut.</hi> 22.3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the eſteem that men have of perſons and things; he ſaies that great men are many times the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. <hi>he ſetteth over Kingdoms the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of men:</hi> and the worſt condition of a godly man is better then the beſt condition of the men of the world; he is of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, <hi>I would that you were altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe bonds; better be a Door-keeper in the houſe of God, then to dwell with Princes: better never to have known the way of righteouſneſs. Having taſted of the old wine, he cannot deſire new, for he ſaith the old is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and it was better with me when I was with my former
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:168372:20"/> husband then it is now:</hi> the rods and frowns of a father, are better then the kiſſes of an enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in a mans election, a wiſe man doth pitch upon a general good before any particular good: it is true, that riches will avail againſt poverty, and honour againſt diſgrace; but theſe are but particular good things, they are not profitable for all things; <hi>riches avail not in the day of wrath;</hi> honour will not ſupport a man in a ſick bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now, <hi>godlineſs is profitable for all things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. <hi>it is great gain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that is wiſe chuſeth that which is moſt profitable <hi>for himſelf, Iob</hi> 22.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. <hi>If thou be wiſe, thou wilt be wiſe for thy ſelf:</hi> Now a man may by other things be wiſe for his eſtate, and be wiſe for his children, but may be a fool for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he chuſeth things that are moſt neceſſary in the firſt place; and <hi>there is but one thing neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c. Mary <hi>hath choſen the better part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he chuſeth the greateſt ſufferings rather then the leaſt ſin, <hi>Iob</hi> 36.21. and not the greateſt ſin rather then the leaſt affliction; <hi>Mallom mundus a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato Gehennam intrare</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Anſelm.</note> 
                     <hi>Anſelm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in a mans ends: a mans wiſdom is in nothing more ſeen then in a mans ends: now a godly man hath high ends; the glory of God, and the good of his Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8,9. <hi>None of us lives to himſelf;</hi> and <hi>no man dyes to himſelf: but whether we live or dye we are the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>whether he doth eat or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he does, he doth all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. ſo that in the natural and civil actions of a mans life, he hath high ends; whereas another man he hath low and poor ends, even in the moſt religious and higheſt actions; if he pray, it is for himſelf, <hi>howl for corn and
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:168372:20"/> oyl,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>and it is but to tread out the corn, Hoſ.</hi> 10. all his profeſſion, ſo much of Religion as will ſerve his turn and no more; if he preach, <hi>it is to gather Diſciples after him:</hi> and they <hi>ſerve not God but their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: pollute my name for a morſel of bread and a little bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſaies God: and if they faſt, <hi>did not you faſt unto your ſelves?</hi> will the Lord ſay: and if they hear, <hi>What went you out to hear, but a reed ſhaken with the wind?</hi> theſe are too mean ends for a Chriſtian ſpirit: their ends are more raiſed when they come to perform a duty; they do not care <hi>to approve themſelves to men only, but to God:</hi> that is true honour which comes from God; not as <hi>Saul</hi> when he had neglected the glory of God and his own ſalvation, now he takes care for a poor low end, <hi>honour me before the people,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, wiſdom doth ſet a man upon the nobleſt actions and the higheſt employments, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. <hi>the way of life is above to the wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in Heaven,</hi> and he ſeeks the things that are above, and is imployed about them, how he may honour God, and edifie the Church, enlarge the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; how he may get his <hi>ſins pardoned,</hi> his <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſubdued,</hi> his <hi>election ſealed: Rev.</hi> 12.1. how he may have <hi>the moon under his feet,</hi> or be an interceſſor in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Church, <hi>to ſtand in the gap and turn away wrath:</hi> how he may <hi>win ſouls,</hi> and be inſtrumental for the publike good; this he endeavours, and he that doth ſo is wiſe: whereas moſt men are buſied <hi>about meat and drink, and apparel,</hi> building for themſelves and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, or are taken up with toyes; fine clothes, a pin, a rattle, is the higheſt things that they have in their eye, as <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour ſpent his time in catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flies, for all he had the weighty things of the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:168372:21"/> Kingdom lay upon him, <hi>nihil aliud quam muſcas Captare:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sueton.</note> 
                     <hi>Sueton.</hi>

                  <head>Doctrine 2.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This wiſdom is the principal thing;</hi> it hath a prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and a ſupereminency above all other things in the world, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.14. happy is the man that findeth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for <hi>the merchandize of it is better then the merchandize of ſilver, and the gain thereof then fine gold,</hi> &amp;c. that is, even the trading for grace in the Ordinances is to be preferred before the choiceſt worldly comforts.</p>
                  <p>But wherein doth the excellency of grace lie? In theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the excellency of grace lies in a conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; the neerer any creature comes unto God, the more glorious it is, and the more happy: herein lies the happineſs of the Angels, yea, and of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, that is exalted far above all the Angels, in this, that it is more like unto God, and all the glorious Attributes of God did ſhine forth in him; Now by grace a man is <hi>renewed and transformed into the Image of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. he lives the life of God, Eph.</hi> 4.18. hath a life from God, in God, and unto God: which is a higher life then any man in the world lives; his life is a moſt excellent life, being <hi>made partaker of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. grace doth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and a man hath all the vertues of God ſhining forth in him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. a man <hi>is holy as he is holy,</hi> and <hi>merciful as he is merciful:</hi> and we do thereby become <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>imitators of God, Eph.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from this conformity there ariſeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: for <hi>between light and darkneſs there can be no fellowſhip;</hi> and <hi>if a man ſay that he hath fellowſhip with him, and walks in darkneſs, he doth lye,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.6. they
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:168372:21"/> only enjoy the divine preſence, that are <hi>made partakers of the divine nature;</hi> and ſuitable unto a mans confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſo will his communion be: an unregenerate man that hath no conformity to God, he can have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God: <hi>two cannot walk together unleſs they be agreed. Cant.</hi> 7.5. <hi>the King is held in the Galleries; thou haſt raviſhed me with one of thine eyes, and with the chain about thy neck.</hi> Zach. 3.7. <hi>if thou walk in my wayes and keep my Ordinances, I will give thee places to walk in amongſt thoſe that ſtand by,</hi> &amp;c. and when a mans confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſhall be perfect, ſo ſhall his communion be: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall be like him, and we ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> An ungracious man can have no fellowſhip: a man muſt be in a ſtate of communion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. <hi>he muſt be made neer, before he can draw neer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now every man by nature is an enemy to God, and cares not for communion with him, but hates any degre of approach to God: he hath another <hi>fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs;</hi> therefore he can have no communion with God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, grace fits a man for the ſervice of God; for, <hi>he hath no pleaſure in fools,</hi> that is a wiſe God: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man by nature is droſs and chaff, fit for no honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able employment: if a man <hi>were to ſtand before a King,</hi> Dan. 1.4. <hi>he muſt be learned in all wiſdom, and knowledge, and underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. how much more he that ſhall ſtand before the great God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>the Lord hath ſeparated to himſelf the man that is godly:</hi> the Hebrew word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to himſelf for ſervice, and to himſelf for communion. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1,2. <hi>he will ſet them before his face for ever:</hi> when the Lord calls men to any ſervice, he doth qualifie them for that ſervice: <hi>Saul</hi> for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but for a gracious work a common unction will
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:168372:22"/> not ſuffice: and if a man have a new work to do, he muſt have from the ſpirit of God <hi>a new ſupply; Phil.</hi> 1.19.</p>
                  <p>The Devil will not imploy inſtruments in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice till they be fitted: and therefore there be ſome ſins that men are not tempted unto at firſt, becauſe their ſpirits are not prepared for them: Satan tempts and prevails with men by ſmaller ſins, and then they make way for greater: But grace enables a man to do and to ſuffer which way ſoever the Lord employs him: be the ſervice never ſo difficult, a gracious heart will ſay, <hi>Here I am Lord, ſend me. Phil.</hi> 4.13. he knows how to exalt God in a ſtate of proſperity, <hi>he knows how to abound:</hi> and caſt him into a ſtate of adverſity, <hi>and the knows how to want, Phil.</hi> 4.13. and grace doth not only fit a man to do Gods work, but alſo to aim at Gods end, for he is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, grace turns all things that a godly man enjoyeth into a bleſſing: but unto an ungodly man every thing is become a curſe: he is curſed in his body, curſed in his name, and curſed in his eſtate, and in all his relations, and in all the creatures that he uſeth: <hi>his Table becomes a ſnare, Mal.</hi> 2.2. I will curſe your bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, nay the Ordinances of God that be unto <hi>the Saints the ſavour of life,</hi> are unto him <hi>the ſavour of death:</hi> it is a means to ripen their ſins and haſten their ruine. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>to the unclean all things are unclean.</hi> So that <hi>Eſau may have the dew of heaven, the fat of the earth,</hi> and yet be hated: and <hi>Saul a Kingdom,</hi> and yet <hi>rejected of God:</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> may have Apoſtolical gifts, and yet be <hi>a Devil,</hi> and <hi>a ſon of perdition:</hi> they may be bleſſings in the thing, but curſes to the man: <hi>ſine ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo

But godlineſs brings a bleſſing into every ſtate, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>the Saints are the heirs of bleſsing</hi> unto every ſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>all things work together for good to them that fear God: all things are yours, and ye are Chriſts: whether it be life or death, things preſent or things to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. mercies or croſſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Chriſt is made the head over all things to the Church:</hi> for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſake, he doth order all things for their good, and doth as Phyſitians do temper poyſon into a wholſom medicine; Gods people are gainers by their worſt eſtates, and by their afflictions <hi>they are made partakers of his holineſs:</hi> and <hi>when their outward man doth decay, the inward man is renewed:</hi> and whatſoever God laies upon them, ſo <hi>it works in them the quiet fruit of righteouſneſs,</hi> it matters not what befall them in this world: though the rain make the way foul, it is no matter ſo it make the land fruitful: for <hi>theſe clouds drop fatneſs:</hi> and therefore the ſoul of a godly man <hi>bleſſeth the hand, and kiſſeth the rod</hi> that ſmites, and ſaies, <hi>it was good for me that I was afflicted: maledictionem benedixit, paupertatem ditavit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luther.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grace is like the Philoſophers ſtone, it turns all into gold. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.18. it is ſaid, <hi>wiſdom is a tree of life unto them that lay hold of her:</hi> it puts a man into the ſame condition that he was before the fall, it brings a man again <hi>into the paradiſe of God, and the Angel with his flaming ſword is removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it fills the ſoul with all ſpiritual excellencies, thoſe that will endure everlaſtingly: and the ſoul of man is the darling of a man: if he looſe that, what good wil a world do him? &amp; the excellencie of the man lies in his ſpirit: and the great and eternal difference between
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:168372:23"/> man and man lies in their ſpirit; there are two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences here below: one man is a King, and another man is a ſubject: one a maſter, and another a ſervant: but theſe differences are but for the time of this life, and then all theſe relations ſhall ceaſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 3.19. <hi>then the ſervant ſhall be free from his maſter,</hi> and the Princes robes and the beggers raggs lie down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>And here be excellencies alſo that ſome mens ſpirits have beyond others: ſome have knowledge, common gifts, and common graces: but theſe ſhall be alike: for after this life if there be <hi>knowledge, that ſhall ceaſe, and tongues they ſhall vaniſh away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. for all this is <hi>meat that periſheth, Ioh</hi> 6.27. the ſoul may feed upon it a while, but it will periſh, and a mans oyl in his lamp will go out, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. all fleſh is graſs, and the glory of it is as the flower:</hi> only the word of the Lord turned into grace, <hi>the Law written in the heart, that is immortal ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. God looks chiefly to the excellency of a mans ſpirit, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. <hi>but my ſervant</hi> Caleb <hi>had another ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. for God is a ſpirit, and the Father of ſpirits, and his eyes are wholly upon the ſpirits of men, and he hates ſin in the ſoul moſt; and ſo the excellency of the ſoul he is moſt delighted with, is the <hi>adorning that is within, Pſal.</hi> 45.1. <hi>the hidden man of the heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>which is in the ſight of God of great price:</hi> and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward excellencies are but ſhaddows of this; gold and ſilver, pearls and perfumes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have an enlightned, ſanctified, ſublime ſpirit, walking above the creatures, and <hi>the Heart in Heaven, where the Treaſure is;</hi> to be brought up to an holy independency towards all things below, and a holy magnanimity and ſelf-ſufficiency, this is a ſpirit with whom <hi>God delights

                  <p>Sixthly, grace will preſerve a man from all evil <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.11,12. <hi>diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, underſtanding ſhall keep thee, to deliver thee from the way of the evil man and to deliver thee from the ſtrange woman:</hi> there is in every age <hi>a Courſe of the world:</hi> for <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.2. <hi>the world is a Sea,</hi> and every man is as a drop emptyed thereinto, and ſwims with the tide: and the happineſs of Gods people is <hi>to be redeemed from it, Gal.</hi> 1.4. In the firſt three hundred years the world proved perſecutors: afterward they turned Hereticks, then Popery roſe, and then all <hi>the world wondred after the Beaſt:</hi> yet in this time there were <hi>ſome</hi> that <hi>did watch and keep their garments,</hi> that <hi>did not drink of the wine of her fornication;</hi> who though <hi>they came out of great tribulation,</hi> yet <hi>had waſhed their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:</hi> we ſee <hi>Noah</hi> in the worſt times, and <hi>Lot</hi> in a <hi>Sodom</hi> of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs to keep their garments. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks of a certain place called <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> which he ſaith <hi>Ignis innocuus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,</hi> that hurts not thoſe that are within, and yet keeps out all evil from them: truly ſuch a fire is grace whereſoever it is.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, try the heart in reſpect of thy darling luſt, <hi>thy right hand, Pſal.</hi> 18.23. there is no man but hath ſome luſt that is moſt beloved, and indulged to. Now is thy heart moſt ſet againſt that luſt above all other ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, grace enables a man to diſcern the ſpiritual preſence or abſence of God in Ordinances, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10. he ſaw the glory of the Lord to depart when the reſt did not; and the ſoul is drawn out to God in the uſe of Ordinances, and he follows hard after God, and he hath the ſpiritual skil to diſcern when God draws neer, and when the Lord departs; for his communion is not with the duty only, but with God in it: <hi>he engageth his heart to draw neer to God,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.13. whereas another man like <hi>Jehu,</hi> is heedleſs in the ſervice he performs, doth not labour with all his heart to enjoy communion with God, nor obſerves whether God be preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: a conſtant heedleſneſs and regardleſneſs in the ſervice of God, is a certain ſign of an hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if ſin be caſt in, grace doth never leave till
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:168372:24"/> it work it out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.35. the regenerate part in a man will be continually expelling corruption: he doth daily <hi>waſh his feet,</hi> and is as a bone diſlocated, till he be again reconciled to God, after he hath ſinned againſt him: for he ſaith, <hi>It was better with me when</hi> I had peace of conſcience then now; when the Lord called me to communion: but <hi>ſin hath ſeparated between me and God:</hi> and therefore in regard of his daily failings alſo, as well as committing any groſs act of ſin, he looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as <hi>Turtullian</hi> doth, as <hi>nulli rei niſi paenitentiae natus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> it is with him as it is with a man in a ſwound, whileſt his ſoul is in him, there is a principle that will bring him to life again: but if a man be dead, it is not ſo: there is no inward working in him, becauſe an inward principle is wanting.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay to me, How ſhould a man attain to this?</p>
                  <p>I will give you theſe three directions at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, be very ſenſible that thou art without it by nature, and what a miſerable condition it is for a man to be without grace. I deſire you will conſider: if thou haſt not the Image of God upon thee, thou haſt the Image of the Devil and thou art under the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who is perfectly contrary to God, and an enemy to him: and thou ſhalt be puniſht with him to all eternity, if thou continue like unto him: and then conſider, all the means thou canſt uſe cannot beſtow grace. Chriſt into the world, and Chriſt into the heart, are free gifts: <hi>Lumen naturae,</hi> nature new dreſſed may make a ſhew, but it can never be <hi>a new man:</hi> it is <hi>a new creation: an act of Almighty power</hi> muſt paſs upon thee before thou art in a ſtate of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. and let thy heart dwell upon this apprehenſion.</p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:168372:25"/>
                  <p>Secondly, wait upon God forit to this end in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinances: <hi>attend at wiſdoms gates, Cant.</hi> 1.16. for this is the bed wherein ſouls are begotten to the Lord, even the Miniſtery of the word, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.2 <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one bears twins.

                  <p>Thirdly, do not only wait, but <hi>cry for it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 2.2,3.</note> make it thy great requeſt unto God from day to day, that thou mayſt have experience of a work of Regeneration; that thou mayſt reſt in no grace but true grace: nor be ſatisfied with <hi>oyl in thy lamp</hi> only, unleſs thou have it <hi>in thy Veſſel;</hi> that thou mayſt not <hi>build upon the ſand, but on a Rock:</hi> for this will be the deſtruction of moſt of thoſe that profeſs Religion at the laſt day, that they have thoughts to <hi>walk in the narrow way,</hi> before ever they <hi>entred in at the ſtrait gate:</hi> O labour that the ſpirit of God may not only have an influence upon thee in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts, but that he may work truth of grace in thee; and that he may not only come unto thee as <hi>forma aſsiſtens,</hi> to aſſiſt thee in ſome common duties for a time, but as <hi>forma informans,</hi> ſo as <hi>to abide with thee and in thee for ever.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is ſaid by ſome, of the Book of the <hi>Revelations;</hi> It is both an Hiſtorical Prophecie, and a Prophetical Hiſtory: the ſame we may truly ſay of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day: It is either a Thanks-giving Faſt, or it is a Faſting Thanks-giving: the preſent mercy calls for the one, the abuſe of former, and the fear of the abuſe of this mercy alſo, calls for the other: the preſent mercy indeed calls for Thanks-giving; but
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:168372:26"/> when we conſider how mercies have been abuſed by us, and what cauſe we have to fear leſt this alſo ſhould be ſo, this calls to mourning and humiliation: there are two things which every godly man is to look at in a mercy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he may obtain it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he may improve it. That he may obtain the mercy; and that he may obtain a right uſe, &amp; a right improvement thereof: otherwiſe though it be a mercy in the thing, it will be a curſe to the man, as I have often ſhewed you. That which the Apoſtle ſaies of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I would allude unto in this particular, in <hi>Heb</hi> 12.10. <hi>there is no affliction for the preſent is joyous, but grievous, but afterwards it brings forth the quiet fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> the mercy in affliction lies in the uſe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So I may ſay of mercy, inverting the words, Every mercy for the preſent is joyous, not grievous, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it brings forth many times the bitter fruit of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and unrighteouſneſs. For its the uſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy makes the mercy a mercy, as the uſe of affliction doth: the learned do uſe to ſay of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and all the good things of this life: that they are things indifferent, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, neither good or bad in themſelves, but according to the uſe that is made of them, and according as the perſon is that uſes them. So I ſay of all the bleſſings that we receive from God: they are bleſſings according to the uſe that is made of them, and according to the condition of the perſon that uſes them, otherwiſe they are not mercies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Lord hath been pleaſed to give us a mercy, ſo let this be one great end of our humiliation, and of our ſupplication to God this day, that we may be broken before God for the abuſe of former mercies,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:168372:26"/> and obtain of the Lord a right uſe of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>This Chapter, out of which I have choſen this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, was the laſt ſong that ever <hi>Moſes the man of God</hi> indited while he was here upon earth, until he aſcended up into heaven, there to ſing <hi>hallelujahs</hi> to the Lord for ever: and this ſong is partly hiſtorical, and partly prophetical: there are four things in the context that are hiſtorical, that yet notwithſtanding are worthy of your obſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the great care that the Lord had of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Iſrael above all the Nations of the world, Verſe 8. <hi>When the moſt high devided to the Nations their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he ſet the bounds of the people according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the children of Iſrael:</hi> It is an obſervable Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; <hi>the Lord gave the earth to the children of men:</hi> ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells you: but yet the Lord will not have the children of men to ſcramble for the earth, to ſee who can get moſt of it; No, the Diviſion of the earth is the Lords; he hath devided the earth, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ſons of <hi>Adam:</hi> which is the meaning of that dark place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. there were two Kings which the Lord calls, <hi>the tails of two ſmoking fire-brands:</hi> and they intend to enlarge their Dominions to take in <hi>Iudah,</hi> and ſet up a King there: No, ſaith God, <hi>the head of Syria is Damaſcus.</hi> I have ſet them their bounds: they are at their height: they ſhall go no further: the Lord hath divided the earth then to the ſons of <hi>Adam:</hi> but hath divided the earth to the ſons of <hi>Adam, according to the number of the children of Iſrael:</hi> the feweſt in number of all people: the meaning I conceive to be this, that the Lord did take ſpecial care in the firſt Diviſion of the earth, that he would chuſe an inheritance in the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:168372:27"/> earth for this people: for ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>he choſe an Inheritance for them:</hi> ſo that he that choſe a people out of the earth to be his peculiar people, he in the diviſion of the earth made choice of a peculiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance for them: certainly the people of God need not fear an Inheritance then. When the Lord divided the earth among the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> he took eſpecial care of them: the Lord in all his Providential Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations hath a conſtant reſpect to his Church, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual care of them: and he adds the reaſon of it, <hi>v.</hi> 9. though <hi>all the earth be the Lords,</hi> yet <hi>the Lords portion is his people:</hi> this is the firſt thing that is matter of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the context.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he then ſets forth the condition of this people when they were in the wilderneſs, Ver. 10. <hi>he found him in a Deſart Land, in a vaſt howling wilderneſs:</hi> the meaning is not, as if this people were ſtrangers to God till then: or that the Lord took no notice of them, or had no care of them; for ever when they were in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 4. then the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>Thirdly, here is a further deſcription of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>the Lord made them to dwell upon the high places of the earth.</hi> It was a Land of Mountains and Vallies, and upon that account called the high places of the earth: but it was a Land alſo where the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the enemies, and carried them without danger in the midſt of the greateſt dangers, thus they were made to walk on the high places of the earth, as men that walk on high, out of Gun-ſhot.</p>
               <p>And then fourthly, here is the plentie of <hi>the Land that flows with milk and honey:</hi> where <hi>they eat the fine kidnies of the wheat,</hi> and <hi>drank the pure blood of the grape:</hi> a Land wherein there was no lack of any thing that was upon the earth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.7,8. all this is but hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
               <p>In the words that I have read to you, comes in that which is Prophetical: for <hi>Moſes</hi> did not bring them into the Land of <hi>Canaan, Moſes dyed in the Land of</hi> Moab, <hi>on the other ſide of</hi> Jordan, <hi>and was gathered to his Fathers.</hi> It was <hi>Ioſhua that gave them reſt, and divided this Land for an inheritance to them: Moſes</hi> propheſied when they came unto the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> this ſhall be their Condition; <hi>But</hi> Jeſurun <hi>waxed fat, and kicked:</hi> A godly man from a principle of ſpiritual wiſdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Divination, will be able to give a great gueſs of men, what they will be: <hi>Moſes</hi> might much gueſs by ſeeing how diſobedient they had been in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:168372:28"/> what they would prove when they came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi> but yet here is a diſcovery that the Lord made by Revelation to <hi>Moſes,</hi> what the condition of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be: the Lord doth not only certainly know what we are, but he knows what in ſuch caſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions we will be: Nay, the Lord knows in thoſe conditions that we ſhall never be put into what we would be, if we were in it: this is clear, the Lord fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells to <hi>Moſes</hi> what this people would be when they came to the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> having ſuch a place, and ſuch enjoyments: and this is alſo clear when <hi>David</hi> was in <hi>Keilah: ſhall the men, ſaid he, give me up to</hi> Saul? <hi>they will give thee up:</hi> and yet <hi>David</hi> went out of the City that night, and was never given up: and according to this we may gueſs, if we conſider, there are many of us, ſome would have wealth, ſome honour, ſome would have higher imployment, ſome more grace, ſome more comfort, ſome more aſſurance, and the Lord denies it. It is becauſe he knows what in ſuch a condition, if thou wert put into it, thou wouldſt prove: and that which thou lookeſt upon as a great affliction, the Lord doth it with a very merciful hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Jeſurun <hi>waxed fat and kicked:</hi> there are two things in the words to be opened.</p>
               <p>Firſt their name: and,</p>
               <p>Secondly their ſin.</p>
               <p>The denomination that is given to them here, and the tranſgreſſion that is charged upon them. I ſhall briefly explain both theſe, and then come to the point that I would inſiſt upon from them: the denomination, what is their name, they be called <hi>Jeſurun.</hi> It is uſed three times in this Book of <hi>Deuteronomie:</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.5. <hi>Moſes was King in Ieſurun:</hi> and in 33. Chapter Ver. 26.
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:168372:28"/> 
                  <hi>Who is God like the God of Ieſurun?</hi> and in this place; and it is uſed for ought I can find but in one Scripture more in all the Old Teſtament. In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.2. <hi>Fear not, oh</hi> Jeſurun <hi>my ſervant, and</hi> Jacob <hi>whom I have choſen:</hi> there are three different apprehenſions that men have of it, according to the threefold derivation of the word.</p>
               <p>Some from <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>rectum:</hi> that ſignifies right, and they are ſo called as the people that had only the right way, both to know God, and to worſhip God: <hi>the Lord had given his Statutes to</hi> Jacob, <hi>and his Laws to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he had not dealt ſo with other Nations,</hi> they were only the right people: and ſo it may be explained by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.19. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>Who is blind as my ſervant? Who is blind as he that is perfect?</hi> What per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and yet blind? yes, perfect in Ordinances and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and yet blind.</p>

But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is derived from a word that ſignifies to ſee, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>dirigit vel intendet oculos;</hi> to intend and faſten ones eye: Now of all people they were <hi>the ſeeing people:</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is therefore called, <hi>the Valley of Viſion:</hi> they ſaw the mind of God ſo as no people in the world did like unto them: they were the ſeeing people: the Septuagint renders it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> the Beloved people; then if you take in all theſe it will not be amiſs: they were the people that had the right diſcovery of the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:168372:29"/> way of God: they were a people that God honoured and advanced above all people: and a people that knew more of the mind of God, and ſaw more of the works of God, then all the Nations of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the tranſgreſſion here charged upon <hi>Ieſurun:</hi> this ſeeing people; It is, <hi>they waxed fat, and kicked;</hi> I ſhall ſpeak a little diſtinctly to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They waxed fat;</hi> there is in Scripture fatneſs ſpoken of in a good ſenſe, <hi>the fatneſs of Gods houſe;</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.9. and <hi>my ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs. Pſal.</hi> 63.5. <hi>Eſt quaedam ſaturitas pinguis ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiae, &amp; ſapientia iſta animae quae carent macreſcunt;</hi> there is in wiſdom, and in the things of God abundant ſatisfaction; ſaith <hi>Auſtin:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> a fatneſs, and a ſoul without this wiſdom is lean; ſo then this is not the fatneſs here ſpoken of, for that would never produce the other, that is, <hi>Kicking againſt the Lord;</hi> Fatneſs here hath a double ſignification; it is two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſignified thoſe that had abundance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; and their hearts wholly ſet upon them; and ſo rich men that have a great deal of the good things of this life, are ſaid to be <hi>fat; Pſal.</hi> 22.29. <hi>they that be fat upon earth have eaten,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.17. <hi>the waſt places of the fat ones ſhall ſtrangely eat.</hi> It is meant of the great and rich men of the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that have abundance of outward things, are ſaid to be fat in Scripture. But that is not all, but you muſt put the other branch to it: Whoſe hearts are ſet upon them, and ſatisfied with them; theſe are ſaid to wax fat. When they have much, and their ſouls are ſatisfied with that much: in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.10. <hi>they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in their own fat:</hi> abundance of theſe outward
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:168372:29"/> things hem in their ſpirits, and incompaſs them about, called <hi>nouriſhing of a mans heart,</hi> in <hi>Iames</hi> 5.12. not only taking the creatures to nouriſh their bodies, but their hearts: being ſatisfied in theſe things they are ſaid to nouriſh their hearts; It was a diſhonour to the Grecians that they were hair-nouriſhing Grecians: it is not ſo great a ſhame to be a hair-nouriſhing Grecian, as it is to be a heart-nouriſhing Chriſtian; that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another thing in fatneſs; and that notes to be dull, dead, ſenſeleſs, ſtupid; all this doth fatneſs intimate, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Go make the heart of this people fat, that ſeeing they may ſee and not perceive;</hi> It notes that a man is become dull, dead, ſenſeleſs; ſo then <hi>Ieſhurun waxed fat;</hi> that is, they had many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, and reſted ſatisfied in them; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Ordinances of God, and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and the fear of them: they were a dead, ſenſeleſs, dull people, they were a fat peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>they kickt,</hi> as well fed beaſts you know uſe to do; for from thence the Metaphor is taken; and herein there are two things alſo.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it notes they were untamed: their untamed diſpoſition; they did refuſe ſubjection to the Lord; they kickt againſt his yoke: and ſo you ſhall find that mercies do make men rebellious: that is one danger: the Lord ſaith of <hi>Pharaoh, For this cauſe have I made thee to ſtand.</hi> I have made thee to ſtand. <hi>I have raiſed thee up,</hi> you read it: the meaning is this: the ſame God that cut off ſo many thouſands in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he could have taken off <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the beginning; what is the reaſon he did not? that by theſe mercies <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might become the
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:168372:30"/> greater enemy to God: that he may ſay, <hi>I know not the Lord: Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice?</hi> ſo you ſhall find in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 5.5. <hi>I will get me to the great men: but they altogether had broken the yoak, and burſt the bands:</hi> they were the worſt and the moſt refractory againſt all the commands of God of every ſort of men whatever: and commonly great men have ſeldom much of this life, but in this manner they kick, as if there were a greater liberty allowed them then other men. It notes their rebellious diſpoſition ſuitable to that, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Iſrael loves to tread out the Corn:</hi> loves to threſh; why? becauſe <hi>the mouth of the Oxe was not then to be muzzled:</hi> ſo much of Religion as carries a preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage with it, ſo much of Religion and the waies of godlineſs they love; but <hi>they do not love to plough,</hi> ſaith God: <hi>I will paſs over her fair neck:</hi> they were grown great, and by this means they were grown tender, and could not ſubmit: now ſaith God, <hi>I will cauſe the yoak to paſs over thy fair neck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is another thing in it: It not only notes diſobedience, but diſobedience with contempt, with preſumption: and ſo you ſhall find in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29. the Lord ſaith of the ſons of <hi>Ely, VVherefore kick ye at my ſacrifices?</hi> It was to offer the greateſt contempt and ſcorn to him that could be: they kickt at the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: this was their ſin: abundance of mercies they received from God: but their hearts were ſatisfied with the mercies, and this made them grow ſenſeleſs before God: &amp; being thus fat, they kickt: they were rebellious and diſobedient againſt God, and manifeſted it with the higheſt kind of preſumption that could be: <hi>this</hi> Jeſurun <hi>waxed fat and kickt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is but one general Doctrine that I have
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:168372:30"/> made choice to ſpeak ſomething to you of at this time.</p>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a people deareſt unto God, that have had the greateſt diſcoveries of God among them, are in great danger to be made the worſe by the mercies which they receive:</hi> here is <hi>Ieſurun,</hi> Gods people, and a ſeeing people, that had the greateſt diſcoveries from God, and yet they are a great deal the worſe for the mercy that they enjoy: it is a point of great concernment; in the proſecution of it, Give me leave to ſpeak to two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, prove it to you, that even the beſt men are in danger to become the worſe for mercies: for outward mercies, I, even for ſpiritual mercies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, give ſome grounds and reaſons to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth thereof, how it comes to paſs that there ſhould be ſo much danger that a people ſhould become the worſe for mercies.</p>
                  <p>For the proof, that you may underſtand the more diſtinctly, let me lay it down in a double diſtinction of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Mercies are either Privative or Poſitive: Privative, that is deliverances, preſervations from varieties of evils and dangers, which otherwiſe we were liable unto; and indeed it is a good rule that ſome Divines have, <hi>Majores ſunt gratiae Privativae quam Poſitivae:</hi> our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative mercies are greater and more then our Poſitive mercies are, though we perceive them not: the dangers that we are delivered from are more then the preſent mercies we do enjoy: Now let us ſee whether Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mercies make men the worſe: when men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:168372:31"/> do they grow the worſe for their deliverance? look to this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26. the Lord ſpeaks of a great Privative mercy: <hi>I ſaid I would ſcatter them into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: I would make the remembrance of them to ceaſe from among men; were it not that I feared the wrath of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, leaſt their adverſaries ſhould behave themſelves ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leaſt they ſhould ſay, Our hand is high: I delivered them from their enemies:</hi> when I took no argument from them for their deliverance, then I took an argument from their enemies: the Lord made uſe of that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I would have given them into the hand of their enemies, but I feared leaſt they would wax proud: what good now did this deliverance do this people? in the 32. Verſe, <hi>Their Vine is the Vine of</hi> Sodom, <hi>and their grapes are the grapes of</hi> Gomorrah: here is the fruit now that theſe men brought forth of their Privative mercies: that the Lord did not give them into their enemies hands: for all that the people grew more wicked under theſe, and their grapes were, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this manner they improved their corruptions: then certainly deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Privative mercies, men are in danger to grow the worſe by them. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38. <hi>Many a time he turned his wrath away, and would not ſuffer his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe:</hi> Were the people the better for it afterwards? No, they grew ſo much the more rebellious. I will give but one inſtance more of Privative mercies, and it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one: And it were well we made theſe our look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſes; <hi>Jonah</hi> is ſent to propheſie againſt <hi>Niniveh, VVithin fourtie dayes and</hi> Niniveh <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed:</hi> the King with the City were awakened and humbled themſelves before God: and the Lord was pleaſed to defer the Judgement; they were delivered: were the people ever the better, or was this deliverance in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:168372:31"/> No, the people were never the better, as appears if you look to the propheſie of <hi>Nahum:</hi> where you have the deſtruction of that people threatned to be at hand: this people that had faſted and prayed, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding vengeance comes upon them with greater fury afterwards. In <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.3,4. <hi>Woe to this City that is full of blood and lyes.</hi> God ſpared her for a time and reſpited his wrath: but then, <hi>his wrath came upon them to the utmoſt:</hi> thus Privative mercies may make men grow the worſe: And men may be delivered, and a Nation delivered, and they growing worſe for it, the Lord may reſerve them to further plagues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are Poſitive mercies, and they are of two ſorts: and men are in danger of growing worſe by both of them.</p>
                  <p>Either temporal or ſpiritual mercies: as if the Lord give men the Scriptures, they are in danger to <hi>wreſt them to their own deſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. if God give them his Goſpel, they are in danger to <hi>turn his grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wantonneſs.</hi> In the Epiſtle of <hi>Iude,</hi> ver. 4. Not the word of grace, but the priviledges of grace; if God give men the Ordinances, they ſay, <hi>The temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> And <hi>we are delivered to commit all this abomination, Ier.</hi> 7.8,9. and ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7,8. there is <hi>the ground that drinks in the rain</hi> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Influences, and yet <hi>brings forth Briers and Thorns;</hi> So if men receive ſpiritual priviledges, they may be the worſe for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. Nay ſpiritual divination, and be in danger to be the worſe for it: <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. <hi>there was ſent a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, leaſt he ſhould be lifted up overmuch:</hi> Nay ſpiritual motions and operations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5,6. there are men <hi>enlightned, that have taſted of the good word of
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:168372:32"/> God; been made partaker of the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and taſted the powers of the world to come:</hi> theſe are great works, and yet notwithſtanding what do theſe do? theſe fit a man for the great Apoſtacy, ſuch as can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admit of a renovation; thus, <hi>When the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit goes forth out of the man,</hi> which is a great common work too, yet <hi>he returns with ſeven worſe ſpirits;</hi> then certainly ſpiritual mercies indanger men; they that know moſt of God and Chriſt, are in great danger to be the worſe for ſuch mercies: And ſo it is true of temporal mercies too, if you will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1. it is a whole proof of the point in hand: the text tells what is the mother of all the decay there ſpoken of, even until <hi>they are called Loami,</hi> they are not my people; What is the mother of all this? <hi>Diblaim;</hi> and that properly ſignifies bunches of dryed Figgs; and it is, and was commonly interpreted to be a great dainty among them. <hi>Cakes of Figgs</hi> were part of <hi>Abigals</hi> preſent to <hi>David;</hi> By this the Lord ſets forth their great plenty and abundance; this is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the people had abundance, and their hearts were ſet upon it; What was the daughter to this people? <hi>Gomer,</hi> the word doth ſignifie perfection or defection; commonly Interpreters take it in the laſt ſenſe; that is, brought forth that great defection, that great conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that came upon the whole Land; then certainly, men may be the worſe for temporal mercies; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I am ſure is plain enough, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.2. <hi>out of the four winds that contended upon the great Sea, there aroſe four beaſts:</hi> When they were grown great ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Monarchs, they forgate to be men, and became beaſts, and never till then: never beaſts till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Monarchs: thus there is a great deal of danger
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:168372:32"/> that men ſhould grow the worſe for temporal mercies; I ſhall give one inſtance more in <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.25,26. <hi>they took ſtrong Cities, and a fat Land: and poſſeſſed houſes full of all goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and did eat and were filled, and became fat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nevertheleſs they were diſobedient and rebelled againſt thee:</hi> here were men that were a great deal the worſe for their plenty; the Scripture is full of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; Let this ſerve for the proof of the point.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay to me, What is the reaſon? are the mercies of God of ſuch a malignant nature? ſo inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed that they make men grow thus and thus, the worſe? A man would think if any thing would make men the better, mercies would; Its true, had men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous natures as grace brings: But there are four great reaſons why it is a dangerous thing for a perſon or people to enjoy mercy, and not be the worſe for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, is from the corruption that is in the heart of man; It is true, the mercy of God is not a cauſe why men grow the worſe: for it infuſes no malignant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition into the ſoul of man. But the mercy of God is an occaſion, though it be not the cauſe; as it is ſaid of the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Sin took occaſion by the Law:</hi> the Commandment gave no occaſion; But, <hi>ſin took occaſion;</hi> the command forbids ſin; but ſin took occaſion to act more violently againſt the command; the more the Dam is made up againſt the water, the more it ſwells; corrupt nature takes occaſion from the Law; <hi>Chriſt is put for the riſing and fall of many in Iſrael;</hi> and ſo is the mercy of God; it is not properly the cauſe, but that which ſin takes occaſion from; Now we are to put a great difference between things
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:168372:33"/> as they are in themſelves, and the effects that flow from them: the nature of the cauſe: and the effects that are not proper from it as a cauſe, but as they look to the ſubſtance: there are two things in the torments of hell: ſomewhat that is eſſential; ſomewhat but accidental: ſomewhat eſſential: upon what object ſoever it lights, he is ſure to undergo it: But there is ſomewhat acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: the wrath of God in the ſoul, is eſſential to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell: So that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going what was due to ſinners, the eſſential part he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, <hi>when it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to ſhame:</hi> But ſomewhat is not eſſential, but may be ſeparated as it is from ſuch a ſubject, as deſpair and the like: and you are in this to diſtinguiſh between what is the proper fruit of mercy, and what is but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional matter, coming to ſuch a ſubject, and taking hold of that: and ſo affliction it is no cauſe of ſin, no more then mercy is: But yet affliction is many times an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſin: It is ſaid of <hi>Ahab, the more he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, he ſinned yet more:</hi> that is the firſt reaſon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the corrupt heart of man takes occaſion to ſin from mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the general curſe that by reaſon of ſin is come upon all the creatures, and all Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſpenſations: you know that antient curſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake.</hi> It notes the ground as referring to a mans uſe, and all the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God towards the creature; there is a double curſe come upon the creature in reference to you. Firſt, as it is decaying, and ſo it is a vexing creature; for this fills the creature with vanity, and that vanity fills the ſoul with vexation. But the great curſe lies in this; it is a polluting and defiling thing now; as it is a means
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:168372:33"/> to defile the ſoul of man: yet notwithſtanding this is the curſe; therefore <hi>to the unclean, all things are unclean:</hi> that is, all the providences of God to that man are means to increaſe that mans uncleanneſs; and that I think is the meaning of that place, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.16. <hi>Whatever is in the world, is luſt,</hi> &amp;c. why, is there nothing in the world but luſting then? the meaning is: there is ſuch a Curſe come upon all the creatures towards man; ſo far as a man is of the world, ſo far they are objects of luſts to him: and draw out his luſts to improve them: and therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of himſelf, in <hi>Iob</hi> 31.26. <hi>If I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Sun when it ſhined, and my heart hath been ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enticed:</hi> there is an enticing goes along with it: what is the reaſon of it? becauſe there is a general curſe come upon all the creatures, and all the diſpenſations of God through the creatures, that all theſe ſhall be means to inſnare and defile the man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly from the eſpecial malice of the Devil againſt mercy: It is true, he is an enemy to all the creatures, and he would deſtroy them all as creatures out of his enmity to God, as he did the <hi>Gadarens</hi> herd of <hi>Swine.</hi> But in a more eſpecial manner the Devil is an enemy to the mercy of God more then to any other creature of God. Why? becauſe the Devils ſin is direct enmity, and malice, and revenge: God looks for moſt glory from his mercy: and therefore of all other things the Devil hath the greateſt envy to that, that God may be diſhonoured by them: take the firſt mercy of the Lords dealing with <hi>Adam;</hi> the Lord made him to be the Monarch of the whole world: But there was one mercy that the Lord vouchſafed him above all the reſt, ſhould be the glory of the man: It was a far greater glory to have <hi>the woman ſubject unto him,</hi> then to have
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:168372:34"/> all the reſt of the world: Now upon this mercy the Devil ſets his malice: and he received her a rib, but the Devil made her a ſnare; <hi>Satans</hi> great aim is, that he may abuſe Gods mercy: if God give a man great parts and gifts above all other men, the Devil deſires to abuſe thoſe parts, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of <hi>Licinius</hi> a young man of great gifts, <hi>Cupit abs te ornari Diabolus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil deſired he might be credited by him: great mercies and great abilities are the ſpecial ſtocks that above all others the Devil deſires to graft upon: No fruit ſo bitter to God as the abuſe of mercy: and therefore look to your ſelves, for it is the Devils great deſign to abuſe your mercies.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there are ſome mercies that God hath given to perſons and people out of a particular diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: you heard of the general curſe that came upon all the creatures before. But now I ſay, there are ſome mercies that God gives out of peculiar diſpleaſure, and they prove a more peculiar curſe. I conceive that will appear plain to you, in <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.3. there is a curſe goeth forth (the general curſe went out ever ſince the fall) <hi>It ſhall enter into the houſe, and conſume it with the timber thereof, and the ſtones thereof:</hi> and ſo if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>I will</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Curſe your bleſsings:</hi> I gave you bleſſings, and notwithſtanding theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings there ſhall be a peculiar curſe: you have it more fully cleared to you, in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>riches reſerved for the owners hurt:</hi> one hath riches, great mercies: they are ſo; <hi>Wiſdom is good with an inheritance:</hi> But many a man God gives riches to out of a peculiar diſpleaſure: and they are <hi>reſerved to him for his hurt:</hi> No wonder theſe men grow the worſe for mercies, becauſe it is out of a peculiar diſpleaſure that the Lord gives them: as
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:168372:34"/> 
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of Gods hearing prayers, <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> he hears wicked mens prayers and gives them things they ask: though not properly as an anſwer to prayer: God hears prayers with revenge: Gives the things prayed for, but out of a peculiar diſpleaſure: No wonder then that men be the worſe for them: take but the inſtance of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. he fought many battles, and the Lord helped him mightily: you will ſay God intended good to this man ſure: No, all this was in diſpleaſure: <hi>he mightily helped him till he was ſtrong:</hi> and then <hi>his heart was lifted up to his own deſtruction.</hi> My Brethren, God doth as much rain ſnairs on men in mercy, as in any other of his diſpenſations whatſoever: and therefore look to it: it is a dangerous thing for a people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy, if they do not improve it.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="application">
                  <p>I ſhall now ſpeak a few words of Application; there are but two uſes that I would make of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of examination: Look back upon all the mercies that you have received from God; temporal and ſpiritual mercies: privative, poſitive mercies. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is your duty; the expreſſion is, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.26. <hi>Bleſs the Lord from the fountain of Iſrael:</hi> Not only for late mercies received; but look to the Fountain from whence all mercies did firſt flow: <hi>Remember the Lord from Shittim to Gilgal: Micah</hi> 6.5. it is from the firſt beginning of mercy to the latter end of them: ask but the queſtion now of your own hearts: look to your own perſonal mercies every one in private family mercies: and the publick mercies that God hath afforded the Nation: and tell me, are you the better or the worſe for them? have you brought forth fruit anſwerable to the mercy? or hath not the Lord cauſe to ſay, <hi>Do you thus
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:168372:35"/> requite the Lord oh fooliſh people and unwiſe:</hi> what are the evil fruits that mercies are in danger to bring forth, by which people are made the worſe? and ſee whether or no a great many of theſe be not to be found amongſt us? and if they be, you may ſay the thing is a mercy; yet notwithſtanding you have little reaſon to take comfort in it: certainly it can never be a mercy to thee: nothing is a mercy to you, but that which you are the better for.</p>
                  <p>There are ſix things that are the ordinary waies by which men do appear to be the worſe for mercy: And pray let us ſee whether all theſe be not to be found amongſt us: this is a day wherein you ſhould lay your ſelves naked before God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ordinary abuſe of mercy is forgetfulneſs of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.14. <hi>When thou haſt eaten and art full, and dwelleſt in houſes that thou buildeſt not, and enjoyeſt wells that thou diggedſt not, then take heed leaſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Lord thy God:</hi> And indeed this is the firſt and the moſt natural fruit of a heart fatted with mercy: for ſo it is ſaid here, <hi>they waxed fat and kickt: they lightly eſteemed the rock of their ſalvation:</hi> the mercies of God make men diſ-regard God: Now I pray conſider: if the mercies that raiſe thee up, caſt God down in thy ſoul, examine I pray: hath reſpect to God riſen by his mercie? look to it each particular foul, and judge your ſelves faithfully: I am afraid I may ſpeak it with a great deal of bitterneſs: reſpect to God hath not riſen by his mercies to this Nation: Nay rather lay aſide all things; for the things of God, we have nothing to do with them. Certainly, this is an evil thing, and is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that men grow the worſe for mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when they are ſettled upon them, and
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:168372:35"/> ſatisfied with them. Let them but keep this mercy, &amp; it will be well with them. Let us enjoy this, &amp; all is well: See how the people are brought in, it is a ſtrange ſpeech, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.31. <hi>We are Lords, ſay they, we will come no more to thee:</hi> God ſet them in a good and a proſperous condition; now we will own God no more, we will raign alone: have we ſeen ſo much need of God in a mercy? or do we ever come in to God but when ſome preſent trouble is upon us? if any great eminent danger be over us, then a faſt: otherwiſe if not for a year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is no matter: as much as to ſay, we are ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mercies and have enough of them. <hi>We are Lords, and will come no more at thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when men grow refractory unto duty, and oppoſe the things of godlineſs with a higher hand: that is another way by which men grow worſe for mercies: <hi>An untamed heifer unaccuſtomed to the yoak:</hi> that is the expreſſion; when you ſhall find ſuch a diſpoſition in you, to reject God, deride his Ordinances, oppoſe the Miniſters, corrupt his Scriptures, or at leaſt endeavour to make them void, by myſtical, allegorical interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thereby make them a ſound of words and no more; when men dare proceed to this paſs, and have a great deal to ſay for themſelves, and againſt duty confidently, this is an evil fruit of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when a people do begin to dote upon their own beauty, God ſets them in a good condition, and they begin to reſt in it, that evil was the fruit of their mercy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Thou waſt comely through my come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs that I put upon thee; But thou didſt truſt in thine own beauty:</hi> this is another evil fruit of mercy, men grow more ſelf-confident of their own wiſdom, and their own ſtrength, and truſt in their beauty; a great
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:168372:36"/> Argument that men grow much the worſe for mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, when men aſcribe mercy to themſelves, and would take the glory from God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Sacrifice to their own net:</hi> and ſay, <hi>this is great</hi> Babel <hi>that I have built;</hi> my wiſdom ſaith one, and my power ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this or that arm of fleſh hath got the victory, the hearts of men run out to ſecond cauſes, to poor inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this is an argument that men grow the worſe for mercies; when they cannot call to mind any former thing wherein the Lord hath been pleaſed to uſe them, but with great Elevation of Spirit; And it muſt not be ſpoken of but with the greateſt advancement of the inſtrument that can be. And,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when men imploy all to their own uſe, when all mens mercies do but ſerve their luſts; one man ſaith, we have obtained this mercy, therefore I will be rich; now I muſt ſit at the ſtern ſaith another; the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the negotiations of the State is in my hands; as much as to ſay, God hath given all theſe mercies to ſerve me: remember that place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.1. It is a Scripture I confeſs you ſhould have much before your eyes: <hi>Wo to</hi> Ariel, <hi>to</hi> Ariel <hi>the City where</hi> David <hi>dwelt:</hi> why is <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> called <hi>Ariel?</hi> you have it rendred in the margent, <hi>the Lyon of God;</hi> that City and that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which had been as a Lyon to conquer all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, that none were able to ſtand before them: yet when they abuſed all theſe barely to ſerve themſelves, the Lord hath a woe for them; have theſe been the fruits that mercies have brought forth amongſt us? <hi>the Grapes of</hi> Sodom: have not we reaſon now as to bewail our wants, ſo to weep over our mercies all this day long? and to conſider how much we are the worſe
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:168372:36"/> for thoſe mercies wherein the Lord hath been merciful to you.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond uſe of Caution, and admonition; do you take heed ſeeing it is ſo dangerous a thing, that the ſame thing be not juſtly ſaid of you, and charged on you as was here upon <hi>Jeſurun:</hi> that they were the worſe for their mercies: the mercies they received did but ripen their ſins and haſten their ruine: take heed you <hi>bring forth fruits worthy of the mercy you receive:</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>bring forth fruits worthy of repentance;</hi> you may remember, it is ſaid of <hi>Solomon, Cant.</hi> 8.11. <hi>he had a Vine-yard in</hi> Baal-hamon, <hi>and</hi> Solomon <hi>let it out,</hi> but he expected to have the incomes of his Vine-yard: the Lord deals ſo with men: whatever the mercies are you do receive, the Lord expects returns for them: and that your mercies ſhould make you thrive and grow more in grace and more in obedience, that you ſhould be the better for them.</p>
                  <p>But what are the natural fruits that the mercies of God ſhould bring forth, that I may know when they are fruits that grow upon mercy naturally, not from ſin occaſionally, that I may ſay, I am the better for mercy?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall name to you ſix particulars, and pray lay them to heart.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the proper fruit of mercy is an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our own unworthyneſs: when the ſoul is made more humble under the apprehenſion of its own unworthineſs, that is a mercy indeed: the Lord directs to this in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5. <hi>they were</hi> to come to bring their firſt fruits to God when they came to <hi>Canaan;</hi> they were to come to God and ſay, <hi>A Syrian ready to periſh was my Father:</hi> and the Lord brought us out of
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:168372:37"/> the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> they acknowledge their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of mercy, when a ſoul can ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> doth, <hi>I am leſs then the leaſt of all thy mercies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the proper fruit of mercy by which a man may be ſaid to be the better for it, is when they aſcribe all mercy to God: when they ſay, <hi>VVe have wrought no deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the earth formed it: it is not my bow nor my ſword that hath ſaved me:</hi> but as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.2. <hi>VVhen God had delivered him from all his enemies, and out of the hand of</hi> Saul: Now what doth <hi>David</hi> ſay? <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my rock, he is become my ſalvation:</hi> God is all in all; he looks on no inſtruments, no ſecond cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when mercies do bring a mans ſins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the ſoul ſtoops under the apprehenſion of mercy: what will God ſhew mercy to me! one ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and diſobedient as I! and then the ſoul reads over the guilt of his ſin with new remorſe: <hi>is this thy Voice,</hi> thy act O Lord whom I have ſo much provoked, that the Lord might have caſt me off ſo long ago? It was ſo with them in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> when God ſhews the greateſt mercy that ever he will give them: <hi>when he will give them ſiſters for daughters,</hi> and exalt her to be the mother Church of the earth; then, <hi>they ſhall remember their waies and their doings, and ſhall be confounded and put their mouthes in the duſt, and never lift up their faces any more when I am pacified towards them:</hi> I might have expected that God ſhould have deſtroyed me rather, and ſent me to hell as well as to captivity: but will the Lord yet ſhew mercy? the ſoul is in bitterneſs for this.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when mercies lay upon the men the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:168372:37"/> obligations, and a man makes this uſe of it; looks upon himſelf as more firmly bound to God; that is the uſe they make of mercy in <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. <hi>after we have received ſuch a deliverance as this,</hi> ſhould we rebel? as if they ſhould have ſaid, if this mercy do not make up the banck againſt diſobedience, nothing in the world will do it: this makes a man as <hi>David, to cleave to God with full purpoſe of heart,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>this God is my God, is my God for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, when the ſoul ſtudies what he ſhall return to God for all his mercies: you know that God not only expects returns, but proportionable returns: And I deſire you would take notice of it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.26. <hi>But</hi> Hezekiah <hi>rendred not according to the benefit done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi> But can our returns be anſwerable to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts? there is a double way to make reckonings even: you can never return ſo much in the thing, but in the will: and ſo much the more as the hand of God is large in mercy, ſo much the more thy heart ſhould be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in returns: and let me offer this to your thoughts: in every affliction it is obſerved God hath ſome one ſpecial end: though the Lord hath many ends do meet in every action, for therein his wiſdom appeareth: But yet notwithſtanding ſome ſpecial thing the Lord aims at in every affliction; and therefore <hi>Iob</hi> goes to God, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, ſhew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me:</hi> there is ſome eſpecial thing that the Lord aims at, that he would have his people to endeavour to find out: and ſo it is in every mercy; though the Lord have many ends in it, yet ſome ſpecial end the Lord aims at in every Mercy, which you ſhould conſult with God about: go to the Lord Jeſus as your Prieſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire direction from him; enquire what ſpecial duties the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:168372:38"/> Lord aims at in this mercy. For you can no more thrive under mercy, then you concurr with God in his ends: ſet thoſe three ends together, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. and now <hi>oh man, what doth the Lord require of thee; but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> But it is good for you to ſpend ſome time to enquire what is the peculiar thing the Lord aims at in every affliction, and in every mercy: that is the way to thrive under, and to be the better for mercy.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that ſoul is the better for mercy when it loves God the more for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. a great mercy <hi>David</hi> had received, deliverance from all his enemies: <hi>Oh I will love the Lord</hi> ſaith he: that is the firſt thing; he doth not ſay, I will love the mercy, and I will rejoyce in the mercy: No, I told you it was <hi>Auſtins</hi> obſervation: <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> It is an adulterous love, the love of an harlot, to love the gift above the giver: Let this be an evidence of your love, that you ſo delight in the mercy, as you delight in the goodneſs of the God of the mercy: and that you keep your ſelves in the way of mercy ever after: why is one particular mercy ſo ſweet? the Scripture ſpeaks of Gods <hi>drawing out of loving kindneſs;</hi> how ſhall the ſoul obtain it? keep your ſelves in the way of mercy; then thou ſhalt be ſure to be kept in the way of loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs continually: there ſhall be a tract of mercies to thee: take heed therefore that your mercies do make you the better; for otherwiſe mercies wronged are the moſt dangerous things that are medled withal.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall I know that I know that I am the better for mercies? Pray obſerve theſe four rules, and I have done.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thy mercies will never make thee the better, unleſs they be mercies that proceed from a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:168372:38"/> and intereſt: What is that? the great promiſe of the Covenant, is, <hi>I will be thy God:</hi> that is, all that is in God thou haſt an intereſt in; then there is infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in God; that mercy is my mercy: <hi>the God of my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the God of my ſtrength:</hi> this labour to be ſure of: what mercy ſoever thou receiveſt, let it flow from a Covenant-intereſt, that thou haſt cloſed with the Lord, and chooſes him for thy God; no mercy will do thee good elſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when a man as he receives all from God, doth direct all to God; that he that is the firſt cauſe is made the laſt end; when the ſoul ſaith, <hi>of him are all things, therefore to him are all things:</hi> I deſire to have no benefit from that which God hath no glory from: when a man doth ſo, it is an argument that the mercy doth his ſoul good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider, this is the mercy that doth you good, when it makes <hi>thy ſoul proſperous:</hi> I would not have you judge of mercies by any thing but with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your ſouls: as God gave <hi>Gaius</hi> a great eſtate, the hoſt of the whole Church, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. <hi>I wiſh thou maieſt proſper as thy ſoul proſpers:</hi> if God hath given thee a large eſtate, great employments, or great digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongſt men, is thy ſoul the better? then thou art the better, but never till then: take the inſtance of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.5,6. <hi>he had ſilver and gold in abundance; and his heart was lifted up in the way of Gods Commandments:</hi> how ſhould I know when God gives me riches in mercy? why, his ſoul was lifted up, and therefore he had them in mercy.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, wherein your prayers to God are drawn forth more for a ſanctified uſe of the mercy, then for the mercy it ſelf: this is certain; it is ſaid of ungodly men,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:168372:39"/> that by the prayers of Gods people, <hi>their mercies are turned into ſnares:</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>let their table be made their ſnare:</hi> and that which ſhould have been for their welfare, let it become a trap: ſo their prayers are drawn out, that all the mercies that they receive may cauſe them to thrive and proſper, that <hi>every thing may work for good together for good,</hi> as the Lord hath promiſed <hi>to thoſe that love him.</hi> And ſo much now for the point which is of continual uſe to you: and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you conſider of what hath been ſpoken.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>God provideth Conſolations in, and anſwerable unto the afflictions of his people, which ſhall have a power to revive and delight their ſouls.</hi>

               <div n="1" type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrine firſt.</head>
                  <p>To begin with the firſt of them. <hi>In evil times the miſery of the Saints of God is more from thoughts within, then from troubles without.</hi> There are three things in the opening of this truth, that I ſhall endeavour briefly to demonſtrate to you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the beſt men they are not freed, while they live here, from unruly un-ſubdued thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That in times of trouble, theſe thoughts come in by multitudes: a mans thoughts are never ſo tumultuous as in troubleſom times. And then,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the great part of afflictions doth lie more in theſe tumultuous and unruly thoughts within, then in all a mans troubles and afflictions without: winds without do not cauſe an earth-quake, but wind within, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, even the beſt men while they live here, they are not freed from unruly and unquiet thoughts. Thoughts, they are the immediate iſſues of principles; the buds and the bloſſoms of the principles that are in a mans heart: and ſo long as godly men live here, they
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:168372:41"/> will have corrupt principles in them; ſo long will theſe principles bud and bloſſom into unruly and inordinate thoughts, while a man is in an unregenerate eſtate: <hi>all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart are evil, and only evil, Gen.</hi> 6.5. becauſe he hath nothing but a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſinning in him: when he is regenerate, yet ſo long as a corrupt principle remains in him, ſo long there will ariſe in him unruly unſubdued thoughts: it is very true, there is a great deal of difference between the thoughts of regenerate and unregenerate men: for in a regenerate man there is a holy government ſet up in his thoughts, they are brought into ſubjection unto the government of Chriſt, even <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, every thought: in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. for let a mans change in his words, in his actions be never ſo glorious, even an Angel before men, yet if his thoughts remain the ſame, I muſt ſay it, he is ſtill <hi>a child of</hi> Belial, <hi>he is ſtill in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bonds of iniquity:</hi> therefore there is a great deal of difference between the thoughts of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and an unregenerate man; and indeed the main re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation lies in that, and is principally diſcovered in it, <hi>purity in the inward parts:</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;</hi> the great change lies in <hi>the inward man:</hi> therefore there is a great deal of difference between the thoughts of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and an unregenerate man: and though there be rebellious thoughts in the beſt men, they are not the top thoughts in the man: you have an expreſſion in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.28. <hi>how long halt you between two opinions?</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Mercer.</note> that is they had 2 top thoughts; they thought as highly of <hi>Baal</hi> as they did think of <hi>God;</hi> and they did ſet up <hi>Baal</hi> in the ſame authority that they did ſet up God: the word of God is ſaid to caſt down <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>every top thought,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. he doth ſo far bring them into order and ſub-ordination, that though they be unruly thoughts, yet they are under controle, and under a higher Kingdom and dominion: now a godly man hath never thoſe: though he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts, yet they are never his top thoughts: they are <hi>thoughts that are brought into captivity;</hi> but yet my Brethren for all that, there will ariſe in the beſt men abundance of unruly and unquiet thoughts, yet for all this they do ariſe in the ſouls of godly men: even in the beſt men, the corrupt principle in them is ſtill bubling up, <hi>the Sea</hi> within them <hi>is caſting out mire and dirt:</hi> and that from a threefold ground: I will but touch it, and paſs to the ſecond particular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the corruptions of the unregenerate part, the remainder of corruption in the beſt men, it is like <hi>fire in an Oven,</hi> the Holy-Ghoſt compares it ſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.4,5. and he hath violent irruptions, their hearts are as hot as an Oven, theſe thoughts ariſe from the irrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the breakings forth of the unregenerate part.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the invaſion of ſome enticing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-objects amongſt them, as <hi>David</hi> ſaw <hi>Bathſheba: Achan ſaw, and he deſired;</hi> conſidered, and deſired: ſo likewiſe it is ſaid, in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16 <hi>Whatſoever is in the world, is the luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life:</hi> is there nothing in the world but luſt? the meaning is, take all the creatures to an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:168372:42"/> man, and they all of them become the objects of luſts, all of them are but means to draw out luſt: ſo that there is a threefold curſe come upon the creature ſince the fall unto all unregenerate men; it is not only a deceiving creature, becauſe it is empty: and it is a vexing creature, becauſe it is promiſing and then deceiving: but withal, it is a defiling, a polluting creature: thus from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of objects, from without, are theſe thoughts drawn forth. And then,</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place: from the injections of Satan: for what are unruly thoughts? it is Satan doth himſelf many times immediately inject: ſo <hi>the Devil put it into the heart of Iudas to betray Chriſt:</hi> the Devil put it into his heart: there are ſome thoughts that come immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from hell, like <hi>fierie darts:</hi> the beſt men then are not in this life free from unruly, inordinate, unquiet thoughts. But,</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place; <hi>In troubleſome times theſe thoughts come in by multitudes:</hi> never ſo tumultuous as in evil times: that as it is ſaid of the thoughts of God, and of his love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.5. <hi>Thy thoughts to us-ward are innumerable, there is none can reckon them up to thee;</hi> So (my Brethren) it may be ſaid of our thoughts that proceed from our fears, when either guilt within, or danger without preſents it ſelf, our thoughts then are innumerable, they flie within a mans Spirit like Atomes in the air, no man is able to reckon them up to his own ſelf: obſerve <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6. <hi>a hand-writing appears to</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazer: the hand ſmote him not, did but write upon the wall, yet notwithſtanding <hi>Belſhazer</hi> was troubled: What was the reaſon? his thoughts troubled him. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they had an apparition of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.38. <hi>they ſuppoſed they had ſeen a ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the Text
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:168372:42"/> why he hurt them not, yet notwithſtanding Chriſt ſaith, <hi>thoughts did ariſe in their hearts,</hi> thoughts did ariſe: but in a ſpecial manner that place, <hi>Iob</hi> 6.4. <hi>The terrors of God are ſet in Battle-array againſt me:</hi> how came the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of God? the terrors of God were let in by thoughts, by thoughts, that was the way, and they did not come ſingle in he ſaith, but they came a whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and an army in battalia; thus did the Lord let in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions by his own thoughts upon <hi>Jobs</hi> perſon: and thus in evil times it alwaies is ſo; an army, an hoſt of thoughts come in upon us: they fall upon a mans heart like bubbles in the rain: and the reaſons are theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe in troubleſom times the ſouls of men are awake; commonly troubleſom times awaken mens ſpirits: in times of proſperitie &amp; peace, there is uſually a Spirit of ſlumber upon men; but when <hi>the Lord emptieth a man from veſſel to veſſel,</hi> that hath been before ſettled upon the lees, then abundance of the lees appear; when God (I ſay) empties a man from veſſel to veſſel, then how full of projects is the heart of man? never brought into danger, but the man his thoughts riſe; Oh how ſhall I eſcape? what ſhall I do? and how ſhall I make proviſion for my ſelf? evil times awaken men that were before lulled aſleep by ſecuritie. But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Satan takes ſpecial care to aſſail the hearts of men with thoughts in an evil time, <hi>daemonum eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las cogitationes ſuggerere.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> Bernard: <hi>Cogitationes oneroſae. Idem:</hi> his great care is to keep men in peace in proſperous times, <hi>to keep the houſe and all that he poſſeſſeth in peace;</hi> but let troubleſom times come once, then he doth ſtir up in the ſoul all manner of unquiet and diſtracting
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:168372:43"/> thoughts, and thereby he labours to add unto the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: as it is in temptations to ſin, their ſtrength lies in the multitudes of them, and in the intention of them: Satans great care is, that he might impreſs the ſame image upon you that is on himſelf; and your great care ſhould be, to <hi>keep your ſelves that the wicked one touch you not;</hi> touch you not, how is that? <hi>tactu quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tativo,</hi> ſo to touch you, as to leave an impreſſion of his own deviliſhneſs upon you: a conformity in you to him: <hi>non nocet ſenſus ubi non eſt conſenſus: quod reſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem fatigat, vincentem coronat:</hi> now Satan is an unquiet Spirit, alwaies full of tumults and reſtleſneſs: why now ſuch a diſpoſition in evil times doth he labour to raiſe up in you alſo, that ſo there may be the ſame image in you that is in himſelf. Thus the beſt men are not freed from turbulent thoughts, and in evil times they come by multitudes.</p>
                  <p>But then, which is the main thing that I am to ſtick upon: <hi>That a godly mans affliction is more from theſe thoughts within, then from any trouble without;</hi> and that will appear by theſe ſix conſiderations: I ſhall deſire you to obſerve them.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, becauſe the eye of God is mainly upon a mans thoughts in troubleſom times, and your thoughts eſpecially diſpleaſe him. When the apparition was made to the Diſciples, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Why are you fearful? Why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? Luke</hi> 24.38. Chriſts eye was mainly upon their thoughts: and indeed theſe are the things that do in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſpleaſe God: the firſt buddings and riſings of corruption doth appear in a mans thoughts: and God doth eye ſin in the riſing of it, in the thoughts, in an eſpecial manner: <hi>ſua quiſque cogitatione ſtat vel cadit:
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:168372:43"/> quia ſpiritus ſanctus auferet ſe à cogitationibus quae ſunt ſine intellectu: eritque templum Dei, ſpelunca Diaboli:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> Bern. <hi>de inter domo.</hi> It is true, that thoughts are free from the eye and cenſure of men, becauſe they are ſecret and inviſiible: But they are known to the eye of the Almighty: He ſees our thoughts afar off: and therefore ſome humble ſouls are more grieved for the provoking the eyes of the glory of God, by the rebellion of their thoughts, then for the exorbitancy of their actions: when the times are troubleſom and your thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you grow unquiet and tumultuous. Now what is it in an affliction, that is the main thing in affliction? That which doth diſpleaſe God, and draws out ſin in the ſoul, that makes it to be an affliction indeed: <note place="margin">Chriſoſt.</note> and therefore I remember <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (ſpeaking of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man) layes down this for a general rule, which we ſhould do well to take with us: he ſaith, that unto him there is but one thing only that he fears: &amp; what is that? that he ſhould diſpleaſe, or offend God; that is the great thing he is afraid of, he fears nothing elſe: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; he fears nothing elſe: why then my Brethren, what is it in an affliction that makes an affliction grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous? That which draws out ſin in me; now the blooming of corrupt principles is in thoughts, there they bud: and therefore I ſay, there is many a godly man, that conſidering the eye of God is alwaies upon his thoughts, is much more affected; I ſay, much more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the continual excurſions of his Spirit that prevail, and unruly thoughts, then he is with all the deviations of actions whatſoever. That is the firſt ground why the main of the affliction lies in this. But,</p>
                  <pb n="550" facs="tcp:168372:44"/>
                  <p>Secondly, there is another reaſon of it, and that is this: this lets the affliction into the inward man: when once the thoughts grow unruly, this lets the affliction into the inward man: while you keep afflictions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you they can never hurt you: therefore Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>fear not them that can kill the body,</hi> and have no more that they can do; all this is but without you, and ſo long I ſay they can never hurt you: but if the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction gets within, then it is like wind in the bowels of the earth: then it cauſeth the earth-quake: Godly men for this cauſe have taken more care to guard their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that they may keep afflictions without, then to be delivered from the afflictions: there are two Scriptures that I ſhall offer, marvellous conſiderable, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. that is one, <hi>I tremble in my ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I might reſt in the evil day:</hi> reſt, there is a double reſt: there is a reſt of deliverance, he meant not ſo: but there is a reſt of quietneſs, and confidence and that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God labour for: keep the afflictions without you, let it not invade your inward man; that is the promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.2. <hi>So he gives his beloved ſleep:</hi> obſerve that Scripture; <hi>it is in vain to riſe early, and go to bed late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs; ſo he gives his Beloved ſleep:</hi> what is that? <hi>Animum tranquillum, placidum laborem;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> ſo Mr. <hi>Calvin:</hi> that let his condition without be never ſo troubleſom, let him be forced to break his bodily ſleep never ſo often, yet the inward ſleep, the inward reſt, and tranquillity of his mind is reſerved; <hi>he gives his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſleep.</hi> My Brethren, ſo long as temptations are kept without you, they will never hurt you: it is true of afflictions too: take a man that keeps an affliction out of his thoughts, that is, from unruly, and turbulent, and tumultuous thoughts: <hi>Huic non eſt oneroſa pauper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:168372:44"/> non ſentit injurias, ridet opprobria, contemnit damna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                     <hi>Bernard:</hi> this man alas, poverty, or injuries, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, or loſs of goods, truly all theſe are no great matter to him: why? becauſe they are only afflictions without: they have not invaded his inward man: That is the ſecond ground.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, unruly thoughts in evil times, are the great part of the affliction, becauſe this opens the door to the Devil; <hi>in patience poſſeſs your ſouls,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: but my Brethren, when your doubts once grow unruly, the Devil enters, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26,27. <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath, nor give place to the Devil:</hi> violent, and unruly thoughts, of what kind ſoever, they do but open the door to that wicked one: every man by nature is the Devils houſe, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43,44. and though in godly men Satan be caſt out, yet he will attempt a re-entry; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>I will go to my houſe from whence I came out:</hi> it is true, it is not ſpoken of a godly man there, but Satan in the beſt men will attempt to re-enter: now, when any affliction ſhall be the means to open the door to Satan, this I ſay is the great part of the affliction.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, it is the great part of affliction, becauſe unquiet thoughts do raiſe up in the ſoul diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and vexing paſſions: for your paſſions riſe by your thoughts, and the affliction of the ſoul lies in this: all the reſt is but the affliction of the body, but the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the ſoul lies in tormenting paſſions; you have that expreſſion frequently uſed, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. and many other places; <hi>a day for a man to afflict his ſoul:</hi> and <hi>that ſoul that is not afflicted;</hi> then the ſoul hath its afflictions as well as the body. What are the ſouls af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? they are tormenting and vexing paſſons:
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:168372:45"/> as that there needs no other miſery befall the body, then if God ſhould leave it to the jarring of its own humors: ſo there needs no other plague befall the ſoul, then if the Lord ſhould leave it to the violence of its own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; this would be like Vulters gnawing upon the heart of a man; theſe ſtir up in a man, fear, and ſorrow, and amazement thoſe tormenting paſſions of the ſoul; theſe be ſoul-afflicting affections: do but conſider what it is that torments the Devils; <hi>they are reſerved in chains of darkneſs to the judgement of the great day;</hi> thoſe chains of darkneſs I conceive to be in a great meaſure their own dark and guilty thoughts, by which they are bound over to wrath, in theſe chains they are reſerved. <hi>What ſhall the never dying worm be?</hi> Nothing but the furious riſings of the thoughts of a mans heart, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflections of the mans ſoul upon himſelf: why then a man needs no greater miſery, if God ſhould but leave him to the tyrannie of his thoughts; for theſe raiſe up in his ſoul perplexing, diſtracting, and tormenting miſeries.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, unruly thoughts are a great part of a mans afflictions; for theſe draw out in a man paſſionate and unruly ſpeeches: you have ſuch an expreſſion in <hi>Iob</hi> 20.2. <hi>My thoughts cauſed me to anſwer:</hi> mens thoughts mightily preſs forwards to words: &amp; by this means paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate ſpeeches riſe from unruly thoughts; theſe I ſay, <hi>do exalt folly. Solomon</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.27. hath ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; <hi>a man of underſtanding is of an excellent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> you read it ſo, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> he is <hi>ſpiritu frigidus: a man of a cool ſpirit:</hi> whereas another man, he is tinder unto every injection: but I ſay, ſuch a man exalts folly, a great part of affliction is in this.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more, and I beſeech you conſider
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:168372:45"/> it: unruly thoughts in the time of trouble, they do rob the ſoul of its richeſt ornament, thoſe glorious inward qualifications which are the ſouls beauty: I will name but three to you. It is inward quietneſs: and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it is contempt of the world: and it is holy mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naminity.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I ſay, It robs the ſoul of its inward quietneſs and tranquillity; and <hi>a quiet ſpirit is in the ſight of God of great price:</hi> the ſoul of a man ſhould be alwaies like the upper region of the air, calm and ſereen, what ſtorms ſo ever, or bluſterings there are below. And,</p>

                     <hi>according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my thoughts:</hi> ſo were the multitude of Gods conſolations; God will give it in the time, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it; but withal, the Lord will give it according unto the meaſure; when he doth bring great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he provideth for you ſtrong conſolations, <hi>that as the affliction aboundeth, ſo the conſolations ſhall abound;</hi> the Lord tells you, <hi>that his rewards ſhall be according to the meaſure of his mercies:</hi> it is an admirable expreſſion in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.12. <hi>according to the meaſure of mercies your rewards are;</hi> the Lord meaſures your conſolations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of your afflictions. Thus then you ſee the truth of theſe two points. Let us ſee now what theſe conſolations were that upheld the heart of our <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here in thoſe ſad times: <hi>thy comforts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſoul:</hi> what were they? I will go no further then the <hi>Pſalm</hi> neither, and you ſhall find that
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:168372:47"/> there were eight that were the great ſtay of his heart in thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>As in the firſt place; he did conſider God beholds them: it is a wrong that is done to his people under the fathers eyes: that was the firſt thing that he did ſtay his heart on; the people of God do ſay, <hi>Surely thou art our father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>know us not, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of us:</hi> we have no greater comfort that we can look at, no friends below, yet notwithſtanding our groans are not hid from thee. That was the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God did not only ſee it; Surely thou haſt ſeen it: but withal he did comfort himſelf with this: God would revenge it; therefore he calls him, <hi>thou God to whom vengeance belongs,</hi> the God that revengeth: <hi>habes ultorem Deum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> 
                     <hi>Hierom:</hi> he was a God that did avenge the cauſe of his people: <hi>he hath ſaid, vengeance is mine;</hi> and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt when <hi>Steven</hi> was ſtoned, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. it is ſaid, <hi>he ſaw Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God;</hi> Jeſus ſtanding; why the Scripture every where ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt is gone to Heaven, and is ſate down at the right hand of God,</hi> but he ſeeth him ſtanding up at the right handof God; what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? that is, <hi>tanquam cauſae ſuae judex &amp; vindex,</hi> ſaith one, as one that was the Judge of his cauſe, and the avenger of his wrong: I, this is another great ground of comfort upon which the heart is ſtayed: My God is <hi>a God to whom vengeance belongeth.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p>In the third place: by all theſe the Lord teacheth his people, for ſo he ſaith in the 12. Verſe, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, and teacheſt out of thy Law;</hi> that is another ſtay of heart in the worſt of rimes: <hi>the rod</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath a voice: hear the rod,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:168372:47"/> and who hath appointed it:</hi> Nay, the rod teacheth a man that it is better to be under the ſaddeſt affliction, and have the graces of that condition drawn forth, rather then to be under the greateſt proſperity, and the ſins of that condition drawn forth: do but obſerve <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Let the brother of low degree rejoyce that he is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> I, you will ſay, he hath good reaſon for it: but, <hi>Let the brother of high degree rejoyce that he is made low;</hi> a hard matter to rejoyce in that my Brethren: a godly man can as truly rejoyce in an afflicted condition, ſo as the graces of that condition be drawn forth in it, as he can rejoyce in a proſperous condition, much rather if the ſins of that condition be drawn forth in it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a teaching in the rod, when a man is brought to that indifferency of Spirit, as I remember the Father brings in <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>Vis me Paſtorem ovium aut regem populorum? ecce paratum eſt cor meum:</hi> Lord ſaith he, ſhall I be a Keeper of ſheep again, or Lord ſhall I be a King over <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Lord, my heart is ready, my heart is ready, willing to embrace each condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This is another thing: the rod is a Teacher, the rod hath a voice. Beſides,</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place: There is a reſt God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his people in the moſt reſtleſs condition: ſo he ſaith in the 13. Verſe, <hi>that thou mighteſt give him reſt in the day of evil:</hi> there is <hi>a ſhaddow of Gods wing,</hi> and the people of God in the worſt condition, they can <hi>lie down under this ſhaddow with great delight:</hi> Look into that precious Scripture, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>I am like a green fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> ſaith God the Lord; <hi>like a fir-tree;</hi> Why? in two things: it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>denſam umbram habens:</hi> ſo the Septuagint renders it: a tree that yields a thick ſhaddow: and it is a tree likewiſe that is alwaies green,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:168372:48"/> 
                     <hi>perpetuo virens,</hi> never caſts its leaves as other trees do in the Winter; ſo ſaith the Lord, ſuch is my defence, you may lie down under my ſhaddow in quiet: and he <hi>gives them reſt in the day of evil.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place; he comforts himſelf with this: <hi>the Lord knows that the thoughts of man are but vanity;</hi> with that he comforts himſelf, that all theſe deſigns ſhall come to nothing, all their thoughts are but vanity: the Lord hath appointed that <hi>he will take the wiſe in his own craftineſs, and his hand ſhall not perform his enterpriſe:</hi> the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>by iniquity ſhall no man be eſtabliſhed:</hi> the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>he will not ſuffer the hypocrite to rule, leaſt the people be enſnared,</hi> that is the expreſſion, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.3. Now let their deſigns be what they will be; with this he comforts himſelf, yet notwithſtanding the Lord knows the thoughts of men to be but vanity. That is another ground of comfort.</p>
                  <p>And then; In the ſixth place, that I may draw to a concluſion; that while they labour for their own exaltation, God is preparing for their deſtruction: that is another thing that he comforts himſelf with; for ſo he ſaith, <hi>till the pit be digged for the ungodly;</hi> till the pit be digged; all this while I do not envy their riſing ſaith he, but rather pitty their ruine: <hi>Impatientia humana non vult habere Dei patientiam.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ierom.</note> 
                     <hi>Jerom:</hi> for God is preparing a pit all the while: that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great ground of comfort in the worſt of times; for my Brethren, <hi>there is a judgement written that muſt be executed,</hi> and many times (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon the place) <hi>faelicitas peccatorum fovea eſt ipſorum:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> even their very proſpering in an evil way, is the pit in which they find their ruine: that is another thing by which he comforteth himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="563" facs="tcp:168372:48"/>
                  <p>Seventhly, (That I may draw to an end) though for the preſent the Lord ſeems to neglect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his people; yet he comforts himſelf with this: that God ſeemed to neglect for the preſent, but ſaith he, <hi>he will bring forth judgement to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> it is true indeed, Gods judgement for his people ſeems now to have left them, it is hid: but ſaith he, the Lord will appear for their ſafety, and he tels them plainly; <hi>that will he executes Iudgement for his people; Iudgement ſhall return to righteouſneſs;</hi> it is true indeed, there will come a time, when <hi>the Saints ſhall rule the world,</hi> there will come ſuch a time, I am afraid it is not at hand yet: I am afraid ſo, for that place in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. I rather chuſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it by that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.12. <hi>That Kingdom and Nation that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh:</hi> not a Gentile, but a Jewiſh Nation: but I ſay, there will come ſuch a time, when Judgement ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to righteouſneſs, and then that propheſie of <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Oriens dominabitur, &amp; Occidens ſerviet:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lactant.</note> there will come ſuch a time, and with this now he comforteth himſelf, that though the Judgements of God ſeem to lie hid, and be deferred, yet it ſhall not be ſo alwayes, <hi>but Iudgement ſhall return to Righteouſneſs.</hi> And then,</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, he comforts himſelf: <hi>the Lord will bring upon them their own iniquity:</hi> their own iniquity; that is, <hi>they ſhall fall in their own devices,</hi> they ſhall be daſhed in peices upon the ſtumbling block of their inventing: <hi>he takes the wiſe in their own craftineſs:</hi> and he burneth them like Bees in their own hive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: and ſo you ſhall
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:168372:49"/> find in <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.25,26. where, <hi>the little horn is ſaid to ſpeak great words againſt the moſt High, and to wear out the Saints, and to change times and laws;</hi> What then? why then it is ſaid, <hi>the Iudgement ſhall ſit, and dominion ſhall be taken from him, and to conſume, and deſtroy, even to the time of the end:</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>Our God will bring upon them their own iniquities:</hi> Theſe were now the thoughts wherewith he comforted himſelf, and by which he did overcome all thoſe troubleſom and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous thoughts that were in his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, I ſhould ſpeak ſomething to the Application of it; I ſhall ſay no more but this, becauſe I ſee I have treſpaſſed.</p>
                  <p>You have heard, that the great afflictions of good men in troubleſom times, is more from thoughts within, then from dangers without. You have heard, that anſwerable unto theſe thoughts God provideth conſolations which do ſuſtain, and cheer the heart.</p>

<pb n="568" facs="tcp:168372:51"/> of the Church to come, and that from <hi>Johns</hi> time unto the ſecond coming of the Lord: And this ſecond part begins at <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. where the Church is made the ſcene of all things propheſied of in this book; the viſion of the <hi>Throne, the Beaſt and the Elders,</hi> are the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church where the Lord hath his Throne, of whom are the Judgements executed upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches enemies for the Churches ſake.</p>
               <p>The whole ſubject of this Book contains,</p>
               <p>Firſt, a repreſentation of the Church upon earth; for there the Lord is worſhipped, <hi>for they fall down, and they caſt down their crowns, and they are thoſe that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the blood of the Lamb: Chap.</hi> 5.9. and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are reckoned as diſtinct from them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.11. <hi>they are round about the Throne, and the beaſts, and the Elders;</hi> it ſets forth their office, and their watchfulneſs over the Saints in their worſhip.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a repreſentation of the univerſal Church in all times, and in all places: for <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9. they <hi>are ſuch as were redeemed out of all Nations, and kindreds, and tongues:</hi> therefore all that have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb in the Churches of the New Teſtament, unto them is this Revelation, and them it doth concern.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is this Church univerſal as it is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made up of particular inſtituted Churches; for if we look upon the Church inviſible, it hath no Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in that, only the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who is the head; and if we look upon the univerſal viſible Church, there are no Officers in it, but here are <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Bretheren,</hi> Officers and members, which do Conſtitute a particular viſible Church, that do meet together to worſhip God, as being the

               <p>Firſt, here is <hi>a Throne, and there was one that ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</hi> Verſe 3. here it is an alluſion to the <hi>Tabernacle and the Temple,</hi> where the glorious preſence of God amongſt his people was manifeſted: that is plain.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.12. <hi>A glorious high Throne is the place of our Sanctuary:</hi> and therefore that is reſembled unto the throne of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17. <hi>there came a voice out of the Temple of heaven from the Throne, ſaying, It is done,</hi> &amp;c. therefore a Temple is his Throne, or, his Throne was <hi>the mercy-Seat</hi> in the Temple, from whence God did manifeſt his preſence to be in the midſt of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it will appear by what is ſaid to be <hi>before his Throne; the golden Candleſticks with the ſeven lamps of fire and the Sea of glaſs:</hi> which was an alluſion unto the <hi>laver of braſs</hi> in the Temple; all were ornaments or utenſils of the Tabernacle, or the Temple: It is true, that we read of another <hi>Throne which ſhall be erected after the thouſand years of Satans binding be accompliſhed,</hi> Rev. 20.11. and <hi>he who ſtood upon it,</hi> was he <hi>before whoſe face the Earth and the Heavens fled away, and the dead both ſmall and great did ſtand before him to be Iudged of thoſe things that are written in the Book, according unto their works, and the earth and the Sea gave up her dead,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and thoſe with him; and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was <hi>the Shape of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Dan</hi> and thoſe with him; and their Enſign was the ſhape <hi>of an Eagle.</hi> And anſwerable unto theſe the Church of God compaſſing the throne of God about, is expreſſed by this Hieroglyfick, the Enſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put for the tribe, as if we ſhould put the Lyon for <hi>England,</hi> the Croſs for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Eagle for the Empire, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.13. <hi>the woman was helped with the wings of a great Eagle to flie into the Wilderneſs; Aquila Imperii Romani Inſigne eſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe <hi>Beaſts</hi> were <hi>full of eyes before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and their wings alſo are full of eyes:</hi> it notes unto us that they are perſons excellently skilled in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God, they are very knowing Saints, for of ſuch ſhould the Churches of Chriſt be made up; <hi>Before and behind,</hi> that is, they are all eyes, to ſet forth the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:168372:52"/> greatneſs and compleatneſs of their knowledge in the myſteries of God, and the mind of Chriſt; or <hi>before and behind,</hi> that is, ſaith <hi>Brightman,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bright.</note> they know not only the myſteries of the waies of God that are paſt, but the propheſies of the will of God for time to come: or elſe, their great heedfulneſs in all their waies, ſpecially towards God, they look before to what they are to do, and to the iſſues and conſequences of things that are to come: and they look back upon the experiences they have had of things that are paſt, and they conſult and compare both.</p>
               <p>And their <hi>wings</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>full of eyes within:</hi> wings do note their readineſs and ſpeed in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the duties that God doth require of them; but the duties they do they are not carried to by a blind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution only, <hi>coeco impetu:</hi> but there are eyes in their wings to direct their actions, that whatſoever they do, they do it with wiſdom, and they walk by rule in all their actions, and not at an adventure with God; and their <hi>wings</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>eyes within;</hi> that is, though the wiſdom and the reaſon of their actions be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by others, yet they have light for what they do in themſelves, they guide their own way, <hi>it is the wiſdom of a man that directs his own ſteps, &amp;c.</hi> Other men have eyes without, and they can ſee into other mens waies, and to direct them: but they judge not of their own waies, that they may lead them with Judgement: It is an expreſſion like unto that of the Angels, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.8. they are ſaid to have <hi>the hands of a man under their wings,</hi> &amp;c. which doth note two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Angels do all things by a ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible manner: they work mightily, but their hands are not ſeen: they are under their wings; that execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:168372:53"/> power that is in them is ſecret.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they do all things rationally, they do manage all their works with judgment, that though they flie, and do make haſte in the execution of their Commiſſion: yet, their haſte doth not precipitate their wiſdom, but they manage all things with prudence, even as with the hands of a man: and ſo it is here, they have wings, and therefore are haſty and ſpeedy in their execution of the minde of God, but yet they do all things with wiſdom and judgement; for their wings have eyes within them, they are <hi>full of eyes,</hi> and there is a great deal of ſpiritual prudence that lies ſecret and hidden in all their adminiſtrations and operations.</p>

                     <hi>The Lord doth ſit upon a Throne in the middle of his people;</hi> Here I will ſhew:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that Chriſt is preſent with his people, with the Churches upon earth unto the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is preſent with them, as upon a Throne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſhew you the grounds or the reaſons of this his preſence. And,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, make an application thereof unto our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that there is a preſence of Chriſt w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Church: that there was ſuch a preſence with the Church of the Jews, that is plain, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.11,12. the Lord ſaies, <hi>My Tabernacle ſhall be with you, and I will walk amongſt you,</hi> &amp;c. the Tabernacle was the place where the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God was ſet up, and it was the place of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and a ſpecial ſign of his preſence; and his walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:168372:53"/> there, notes a continual reſidence there, as he ſaith of <hi>Sion, here will I dwell for ever, this is my reſt, for I have deſired it:</hi> and this is applyed by the Apoſtle unto the Churches of the New Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the living God:</hi> it is not there ſpoken of them as particular perſons, though it be true that the bodies of the Saints are called, <hi>the Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> of each particular Saint; but it is ſpoken there of them as a <hi>Church,</hi> as a people embodyed, and the Lord ſaith, they ſhal have a ſpecial preſence amongſt them, even as there was a ſpecial preſence of God in the Temple; and therefore Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>go down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden to feed in it, and to gather Lillies:</hi> as <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.2. for <hi>as a garden encloſed, is my beloved unto me. Chap.</hi> 4.12. and the ſame courſe and walk does the Lord keep ſtill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. <hi>Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he dwels with them: and God himſelf will be with them and be their God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he walks in the middle of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks,</hi> and they are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches, and ſo twill be in the latter daies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the preſence of the Lord is as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a King upon his throne: there is a throne of Chriſt <hi>upon the Firmament over the heads of the living creatures,</hi> which ſets forth the authority and ſoveraignty that Chriſt hath over the Angels which act the wheels, and by whom all things are governed; they have the ſpirit within them, and his voice without them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.26. for the throne of Chriſt is exalted above all the Angels of God, <hi>above all principalities, and powers, and dominion, and every name that is named,</hi> &amp;c. but this is a throne of Chriſt in the Heavens; but there is a throne of Chriſt (as upon the Firmament) ſo there is his
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:168372:54"/> throne and his Sanctuary alſo, and that is the preſence here ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a throne of glory and majeſty; the Throne, the Scepter, and the Crown, are <hi>inter regalia,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the royalty of the great King; all theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto Chriſt; <hi>the Crown, he is crowned with glory, and honour,</hi> and he hath a <hi>Scepter,</hi> which is ſometimes <hi>the Word, Pſal.</hi> 110.2. and ſometimes <hi>the Sword, Ezek.</hi> 21.10. what if it deſtroy the King, and reach unto the greateſt amongſt men? for judgement ſhall in a ſpecial manner reach them, Verſe 14. It was part of <hi>Solomons</hi> glory, that <hi>he built unto himſelf a high throne of Ivory;</hi> and a King ſitting upon this throne appears in his glory: and therefore at the laſt day, when that great <hi>white throne of Chriſt</hi> ſhall be erected, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he ſhall ſit upon the throne of his glory,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.4. and <hi>the glory of the Lord went up from the Chimney, and ſtood over the threſhold of the houſe, and the houſe was filled with the cloud,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo there is in the middle of his people, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. ult. <hi>we beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord;</hi> there is that diſcovery of Chriſt to be glorious amongſt his people, as there is nowhere in the world beſide; they ſee <hi>he is altogether lovely:</hi> they can ſee a beauty and an excellency in him above all the world; they are able to <hi>deſcribe him in his glory from head to foot;</hi> when other men ſay, <hi>What is thy beloved, there is no beauty or comlineſs in him, that he ſhould be deſired:</hi> now as the Lord did to <hi>Moſes</hi> when he did deſire him, <hi>ſhew me thy glory, the Lord cauſeth his goodneſs to paſs before him:</hi> and ſo <hi>Iob</hi> 42.5. <hi>Now my eyes ſee thee,</hi> &amp;c. it was ſuch a diſcovery of glory as he never had before, and ſo it was with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.34. and ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. <hi>they ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:168372:54"/> writ in their fore-heads:</hi> as in <hi>Heaven the habitation of his holyneſs and glory,</hi> there are ſuch diſcoveries given forth of God, which alſo are voluntary, and in ſuch a degree as he pleaſeth; for there is a <hi>Lumen gloriae,</hi> as well as <hi>gratiae,</hi> that is, from the ſpirit of illumination; and as God is pleaſed to diſcover more or leſs of his glory, ſo have the Saints in heaven more or leſs glory; for their glory conſiſts in viſion, the more they ſee of him, the more they enjoy him, and the more they are made like unto him: ſo it is in this life alſo: <hi>there is a Viſion of faith, and it is more or leſs according unto the different degrees of the Spirit of illumination, Eph.</hi> 1.17. and it is this revelation of Chriſt that is the ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>he that ſees the ſon and believes in him;</hi> and ſo <hi>Iſaiah ſawe his glory and ſpake of him, Ioh.</hi> 12.41. There are different diſcoveries made unto the ſouls of the Saints of the excellency of his perſon, <hi>the King in his beauty:</hi> the all ſufficiency of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>the glory of his holineſs,</hi> the fulneſs of his ſpirit, the compleatneſs of his victories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſee what a common work did to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and how mightily it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected him and tranſported him: how much more then a ſaving and a ſupernatural work upon the ſouls of the Saints? the viſion of Chriſt in his glory will be much illuſtrated: as it is by a diſcovery of ſin in its filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when <hi>the Lord ſets a mans ſin in order before him: the Law entred that the offence might abound, Rom.</hi> 7. not to make it to be more then it is, for the Law adds no evil unto ſin, but it diſcovers it, that a man ſees it to be the moſt hateful thing, that which before he loved more then his life, and could venture all to attain it; now he would give any thing to be rid of it: ſo there is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt that is manifeſted unto his people in the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:168372:55"/> Goſpel, by which they are really and ſpiritually affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and carried out into love and admiration of him, <hi>the vail of the covering that is upon all fleſh,</hi> being taken away; and according to the reality and fulneſs of this diſcovery, ſo doth a mans affections riſe towards him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>I will manifeſt my ſelf to him:</hi> he had a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation before, but he ſhall have a further manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Lord doth ariſe in the ſoul <hi>as the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> as the morning; <hi>his goings forth are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as the morning that ſhines more and more unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day;</hi> and the more of the glory of Chriſt is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Goſpel, the more the man doth ſee <hi>the King upon his Throne;</hi> for he doth ſit upon a Throne of glory in the middle of his people; as it is with ſin, there is a rational conviction of ſin, and that is light without heat; and ſo there is a rational revelation of Chriſt, that will harden the heart, but will never melt it: as there are Conſolations from men taken out of the word, but they will never ſatisfie the ſoul: ſo there are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Chriſt from men, which is but by <hi>the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ear;</hi> but there is a ſight of him, and it is that only doth affect the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a throne of ſoveraignty; a throne doth belong to a King, and ſo is a note of ſupream au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: ſo in the government of the Angels, <hi>the voice</hi> that commands them <hi>is from the throne that is in the Firmament over their heads, Ezek.</hi> 1.25. ſo doth the Lord ſit upon his throne, and all his people are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about him, that they may <hi>ſit down at his feet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Law, Deut.</hi> 33.3. and he gives Laws unto the conſciences of men, for <hi>the word is mighty in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſharper then a two-edged ſword, dividing between the joynts and the marrow, and diſcerns the ſecret intentions
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:168372:55"/> of the heart, Heb.</hi> 4.12. The efficacy of the Law depends upon the authority of the Law-giver: and therefore till that be ſeen, the Law is of no power: when a man doth ſee that it comes from him that is Lord of the conſcience, and Judge of the conſcience: as what is the reaſon that at the day of Judgement the conſcience ſhal be ſpecially awakened, <hi>to accuſe, or excuſe men, Rom.</hi> 2.15,16. it is becauſe then the majeſty of the Law-giver ſhall be then moſt gloriouſly ſeen, and in the authority of the Law giver lies the efficacie of the Law: that as <hi>upon Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>the mountain did ſhake when the Lord did utter his voice;</hi> ſo there ſhall be a ſhaking and a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſtruck into the hearts of men; they ſhall have a dread and an awe upon them of that Majeſty and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from whence it comes, though before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it not. It is wonderful to ſee the impreſſions that are made upon the ſouls of unregenerate men by this authority, when they have but a glimps from a common work of this <hi>King upon his Throne.</hi> Oh how it damps luſt, <hi>brings down ſtrong holds</hi> of ſin, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all their reaſonings, and unſettles a mans former ſinful peace, that <hi>the bed is too ſhort, and the covering too narrow:</hi> the man cannot <hi>lie down</hi> as formerly <hi>under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of lies; his ſweet morſels</hi> now are not ſweet to him, but <hi>his mouth is filled with gravel.</hi> As to have ſeen the River <hi>Iordan</hi> to run backward in its own channel: and to ſee the Sun to go back in its own orb, it was a mighty word that muſt do this; to ſee that the fire could not burn in the furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and yet their natures with their natural properties ſtill to be continued: even ſo mighty a work there is upon the ſouls of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men: but for a Law to come forth from the Lord, and that very word to be written upon the heart, and
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:168372:56"/> to be put in there as an indelible character never to be blotted out, though indeed ſin may ſoyl it and blur it, yet it can never be blotted out nor obliterate, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2,3 that the conſcience ſhall ſtand in awe of it, that a man ſhall not dare do any thing that is contrary to it, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>My heart ſtands in awe of thy word:</hi> that though he had never ſo great an inclination within, and never ſo violent temptations without, that he cannot get the authority of it off from his ſpirit: and not only to do this by force, but willingly and cheerfully: <hi>thy Commandments are my delight,</hi> that <hi>he loves the Law of God, and delights in it according unto the inward man;</hi> if a man ſhould come and ſpeak to a Marble, and with his voice thereby words ſhould be written, ſo that they could never be blotted out again, we would ſay this were a mighty voice; there is the ſame power put forth when the Lord Jeſus is in the middle of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, giving Laws unto their conſciences as the <hi>King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne:</hi> when the Law comes from Chriſt upon his throne, it puts a kind of moral impoſſbility upon the man, that he ſaies, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God! we can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth; we cannot but ſpeak the things that we have heard and ſeen;</hi> there is an inward impulſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that a man cannot do otherwiſe: as it is in the Law of ſin, it doth ſo command the man, that the man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do otherwiſe, becauſe there is a Law within him, and that hath the commanding power over the man, that though ſometimes they would ſtrive or give any thing it were otherwiſe, yet they cannot reſiſt it, there is amoral impotency, he is not able to reſiſt the doing of evil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is <hi>a Throne of grace,</hi> and therefore it is
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:168372:56"/> commonly ſo called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us come with boldneſs unto the throne of grace;</hi> a King upon his throne doth pronounce pardon and give gifts: and therefore when the Lord Jeſus did enter into his glory, and take poſſeſſion of his Kingdom, thed he did ſhed abroad his Spirit abundantly: but it did come from the King upon his throne: then he doth delight <hi>to give gifts</hi> as a King, and to ſhew mercy as a King.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſitting on his throne he doth diſpence the greateſt gifts from it; it is from his preſence in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that he doth diſpence the ſpirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.5.14. the <hi>ſeven ſpirits are before the throne:</hi> it is not ſpoken of the perſon of the Spirit, for that is but one, but of the gifts of the ſpirit, which becauſe they are many, therefore for their variety, their multiplicity, and their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are ſaid to be <hi>ſeven ſpirits:</hi> therefore there they are to be diſpenced by Chriſt at his pleaſure: but it is as he ſits upon the throne, that he doth it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21. <hi>The River of the water of life clear as Chryſtal, proceeded out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb:</hi> By this all light is meant; for Doctrine is compared unto water, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine to <hi>a flood, Rev.</hi> 12. and alſo all grace is compared unto <hi>water, Rev.</hi> 4.6. <hi>there was before the throne a Sea of glaſs clear as Chryſtal:</hi> ſo now it is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again; thoſe Doctrines that had been mudded and darkned under Popery, and by all <hi>the ſmoak that ariſes out of the bottomleſs pit:</hi> now they begin to clear again, and there is no mudd in them, <hi>&amp;c. the ſpirit is given by the hearing of faith, Gal.</hi> 3.2. that is by the preaching of the doctrine of faith: for <hi>faith</hi> is there put for the doctrine of faith, as alſo that place, <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith that was once given to the Saints:</hi> it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vain for men to expect ſpiritual gifts and graces
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:168372:57"/> anywhere elſe: for it is only from the King upon his throne: and the ſeven ſpirits are only to be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne; if a man had gone into any other Pool then <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and expected the moving of the water, it had been no wonder if he had returned aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and if the Iſraelites will go out to gather manna upon the Sabboth day, when the Lord told them it ſhould not fall, it is no wonder if they found none: and ſo it is with all that will go out of Gods way, and Chriſts way, and yet will expect the influences of the ſpirit, and that the Angel ſhould move the waters, and that they ſhall find manna, though the Lord hath told them the contrary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhall but <hi>ſow the wind and reap the whirlwind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is upon a throne that he doth grant pardon, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. <hi>he ſhall be a Prieſt upon his throne:</hi> both the offices of a King and Prieſt ſhall meet in one perſon, and they ſhall both concur unto the ſame emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and glorious ends, which ſhall be <hi>peace:</hi> both the making of peace and the ſpeaking of peace; as the Prieſt under the Law was to offer the ſacrifice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace; and as King he doth <hi>ſpeak peace, he ſends a Meſſenger one of a thouſand to declare to a man his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> if a man had a pardon from a thouſand ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it would do him no good; but when the King ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon his throne, ſhall give him a pardon, then he ſaith, <hi>that his ſoul is delivered from going down into the pit;</hi> when a man comes into the preſence of Chriſt, and ſees his glory, and hath a diſcovery made to him, and he ſees his name written in the heart of Chriſt, though Chriſt come as a Judge ſitting upon his throne, and his ſoul is ſet before him, either to be accuſed or condemned, and <hi>Chriſt ſaith, be of good cheer, thy ſins be
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:168372:57"/> forgiven: eat thy meat and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God accepts thy works: let his ſoul be delivered from death, for I have found a ranſom:</hi> hereupon, <hi>the man revives, and his fleſh comes again as the fleſh of a young child:</hi> and he doth return unto the dayes of his youth, and walks no more drooping under his own darkneſs, that made his ſtrength decay, and made him grow old in his youth: now he grows young when he is old; <hi>renews his ſtrength as the Eagle:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17. the <hi>voice from the throne ſaies, It is done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a Throne of Judgement; for <hi>out of the throne comes thunderings, and lightenings, and voices, Rev.</hi> 4.5. there do not only mercies and graces aſcend upon the Saints, but there are alſo very terrible things againſt the enemies of Chriſt, and theſe Judgements are either temporal, or ſpiritual: either upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, or upon the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, upon the enemies of Chriſt there are great Judgements that proceed out of the throne: he did <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Iudas unto Satan</hi> in an Ordinance, when he ſtood upon his throne, and ſo he doth <hi>bind men over unto wrath:</hi> for his ſitting on this throne of Iudgement, is but a <hi>praeludium</hi> to the Iudgement that he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt his enemies in the great day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Go, make the hearts of this people fat, and make their ears heavy:</hi> of all Iudgements none are like ſpiritual Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And alſo great temporal Iudgements, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3,5. there was <hi>a golden Altar before the throne, and from the incenſe offered upon that Altar, there came forth thunderings, and lightenings, and voices, and earth-quakes,</hi> &amp;c. this is all the Trumpets of Iudgement that ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Churches enemies, they did all come forth of the throne; though the prayers of the Saints
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:168372:58"/> did procure them; and all the ruines and over-throws that ever have befalen the enemies of Chriſt, and the Goſpel, have proceeded from this throne, when God is exalted amongſt his people; and let us comfort our ſelves with this, <hi>the Lord raigns for ever:</hi> he doth ſtill ſit upon the ſame throne of Iudgement, and therefore ſo long as he ſits upon his throne, <hi>he will ſcatter away every evil thing,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.8. <hi>A King that ſitteth on his throne of Iudgement, ſeatters away all evil with his eyes,</hi> &amp;c. let what enemies there will ariſe, they ſhall fall by <hi>the thundring, and lightning, and voices that come from this throne.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, againſt Gods own people: for, <hi>his throne is eſtabliſhed by righteouſneſs,</hi> and therefore he will not ſpare his own people when he is in the middle of them: but as he doth delight himſelf in their graces, and therefore loves to be in the middle of them: ſo he will puniſh their corruptions alſo: and there are ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Iudgements for them alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4,5. <hi>Yet I have ſomething againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt loſt thy firſt love, and I will come againſt thee quickly except thou repent, and will remove thy Candleſtick from thee:</hi> which is the greateſt ſpiritual Iudgement that can befall a people; that though they that were godly, ſhould continue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtill, and they could never be caſt out of the number of the inviſible Church, yet they ſhall be looked upon as a viſible Church unto Chriſt no more, but he will take away the Ordinances, and will depart from them, and they ſhall fade away in their iniquities: and ſo for temporal Iudgements alſo, as ſickneſs, yea and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, it is a ſentence that the Lord Ieſus doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce from his Throne, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>For this cauſe many of you are ſick and weak, &amp; many of you fall afleep;</hi> &amp;
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:168372:58"/> yet they are therein <hi>chaſtiſed of the Lord, that they might not be condemned with the world:</hi> it is done in mercy, and not in wrath; <hi>in much compaſsion</hi> unto their ſouls doth the Lord lay affliction upon their bodies, yea even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death it ſelf: for they that are <hi>embraced with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loving kindneſs,</hi> may ſometimes dye under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral diſpleaſure, as it ſeems <hi>Ioſiah</hi> did, and ſo have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Saints.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="1" type="application">
                  <head>Vſe.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, be exhorted to ſee Chriſt as preſent upon the throne: for without this you come not to him, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the duty: he doth call unto you, <hi>behold me, behold me:</hi> that worſhip that is terminated in any thing below him, is a <hi>falſe worſhip;</hi> and that faith alſo that doth not raiſe the ſoul up to him, is a <hi>feigned faith:</hi> but what are the ſigns of his preſence? how ſhould a man know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be preſent or no? theſe three things being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, you may try whether you have ever found him thus preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord is preſent unto no unregenerat men in their duties: they that <hi>live without God,</hi> do pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, and they faſt without God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt firſt deſire his preſence unto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: for as I have often told you, an unregenerate mans ſervices are no more accepted by God, then when he ſwears, or lyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for his ſervices proceed from the ſame principle that his ſins do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is not alwaies preſent unto the Saints, but he doth ſometimes withdraw himſelf, as the Spouſe complains, <hi>My beloved hath withdrawn himſelf,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:168372:59"/> they ſeek him, but they find him not, he doth hide his face, and he doth cover himſelf with a cloud,</hi> that though they ſeek the Lord, yet he is a ſtranger unto them, if they walk in the waies of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, even when he is preſent to the Saints, yet he is not preſent to all of them in the ſame meaſure: ſome have a fuller preſence of God, and a clearer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; as ſome have a clearer Revelation of his mind, ſo ſome have a clearer diſcovery of his preſence then others in this life: and it is ſo with the Saints even in glory, that they <hi>behold his face continually;</hi> yet they have divers degrees of glory: ſome have a more full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcovery of God then others have.</p>
                  <p>When God is preſent to the Saints here;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the heart will be over-awed; there is nothing will over awe the heart but Gods preſence; <hi>how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this place,</hi> ſaies <hi>Iacob;</hi> he had a diſcovery of God to him as preſent with him, and it made the very place fearful to him; the heart of man is very fearleſs of God naturally; when a man doth come into the preſence of God without Conſideration, and goes out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence without fear, it is a ſign that God was not preſent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if God be preſent, thy heart will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to loath thy ſelf; for <hi>he that ſees God in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will ſurely abhor himſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Iob 42.5,6. <hi>and will ſee himſelf undone:</hi> there is no ſoul that ever enjoyed the preſence of God, but it makes him nothing of himſelf; and ſo do the glorious Angels in heaven; <hi>God is all in all</hi> unto them, and they are in themſelves nothing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the Lord be preſent with thee, thy heart will fall in love with him, and thou wilt be carried out in admiration of him: when a man <hi>ſees the beauty
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:168372:59"/> of God and his glory in the Sanctuary,</hi> a man would <hi>dwel there for ever, he would dwel in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of his life</hi> converſing with God, and he would not be weary, but it is weariſom to converſe with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties only: <hi>Moſes</hi> was not weary when he was in the Mount converſing with God 40. daies, his heart was ſo taken up with him: and the reaſon why men love him no more, and are no more carried after him, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee him no more; and the Saints in heaven therefore are carried after him more then we are, becauſe they have more of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he that ſees God preſent ſitting upon his Throne, will ſurely fear to ſin againſt him; therefore all ſinners <hi>caſt God behind their back,</hi> they cannot ſin elſe; he that ſees God alwaies preſent and walks before him, he dares not tranſgreſs, he is ſtill in the ſight of the Iudge: he muſt draw the curtain that offends but in the ſight of a temporal Iudge, as he did before his fathers picture: therefore the Angels ſouls in heaven are impeccable, becauſe they have alwaies a living and bleſſed preſence of God with them, that they cannot turn aſide unto any thing elſe, being in this infinitely ſatisfied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it would make a man ſincere before him; open thy heart, for thou art in his preſence that knows the heart, and weighs thy actions, and ponders they pathes, and if we could hide it before men, there is no hiding of it before him: he ſits upon his Throne that ſhall be thy Iudge: ſo much hypocriſie as there is in any man in duty, and the more any man doth cover his ſin before God, the leſs of his preſence is with that man; it is dangerous <hi>to compaſs God about with lyes,</hi> and when <hi>a mans heart doth not fulfill after his lips,</hi> but in
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:168372:60"/> his confeſſions and ſupplications hath reſerves: God will make his preſence terrible to ſuch a man.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, where Chriſt is preſent, the ſoul is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with him: <hi>it holds him, and it would not let him go:</hi> it ſaies, <hi>Oh</hi> that he might be with me alwaies, <hi>it is good to be here;</hi> the impreſſion of thy preſence, I will have it ever more kept in the heart of thy ſervant, and the ſoul is carried after him <hi>to ſeek his face,</hi> and there is nothing elſe will ſatisfie him: and he fears nothing ſo much as his departing, his ſoul withers with the thought of it; but if thou findeſt none of theſe, yet Chriſt is preſent when the ſoul mourns for the want of him, and groans after him; <hi>he puts in his finger at the hole of the door, and my heart failed when he ſpake;</hi> that a man cannot be quiet if he find him not: now he will after him again, and is reſtleſs till he find him; there is a preſence of Chriſt, though the ſoul diſcern it not: for it is this makes the ſoul follow hard after him.</p>

               <p>In extraordinary duties we may expect an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary preſence, and we are to look for it; indeed there is not a ſervice but the Lord hath promiſed a bleſſing to it: they are all <hi>wells of ſalvation,</hi> out of which the ſoul may with joy draw water: they are all of them but <hi>faſciae Chriſti,</hi> the garments with which he goes forth amongſt men, &amp; they all of them <hi>ſmell of Myrrh, Aloes, and Caſsia, Pſal.</hi> 45.8. but yet this <hi>King of Saints,</hi> though he keeps a conſtant royal Table, at which with the Saints he himſelf ſits, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.12. yet he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes a feaſt like a King, and gives to all his people extraordinary entertainment, he doth never go forth amongſt his people but he doth <hi>ſpargere miſsilia,</hi> diſpence a dole; but there are extraordinary times when the bounty and munificence of the King more appears, and then the priſons are opened, and the Conduits run with wine, and the Cocks with roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the great ground of faith to raiſe your expectations is, that the Lord Chriſt hath in his own perſon and practice ſanctified the duty of faſting to this end: Why did Chriſt faſt, ſeeing he had no diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or bodily diſtempers, nor no diſtemper of Spirit? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why was he baptized, ſeeing he had neither ſins to be pardoned or ſubdued? there were two ſpecial reaſons for it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he might <hi>fulfill all Righteouſneſs,</hi> and all
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:168372:62"/> duties laid down in the Word, that he might perform them; as that in his active obedience there might be a <hi>conſummatum eſt,</hi> as well as in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he might ſanctifie the duty, and leave a bleſſing upon it unto us; for he did faſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, with reference to his body. Chriſt did all as the firſt fruit, which did ſanctifie the whole crop. <hi>Maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioni benedixit, paupertatem ditavit, ignominiam glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit:</hi>

                  <hi>Luther.</hi> Surely, he that is able to ſanctifie death in his own perſon, is able alſo in his perſon to ſanctifie duty, and this is the duty that the Lord hath highly honoured in all the great reformations that ever were in the world. In the example of <hi>Moſes, Elias</hi> and Chriſt himſelf: and therefore we may expect, if we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly intend reformation, God will honour and bleſs it unto us alſo. But, <hi>if it be ſuch a faſt as the Lord hath choſen, and in which he delights, it muſt be a day for a man to afflict his ſoul, for that is the duty of a faſt, Iſa.</hi> 58.5. I know the Hebrews do put ſoul for perſon, and the humiliation ſhould reach to the whole man, but yet ſo as that which is the main in the man do not paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled, nor un-affected: <hi>rend your hearts and not your garments,</hi> it is the ſoul hath the great hand in the ſin, it is the ſoul that is the ſole and the arch-rebel againſt the Law: now only to humble the body is but Mountebank-like, to lay ſalve to the weapon, but not to the wound.

                  <note place="margin">Zanch.</note> the keeping of a Vineyard is matter of great labour and continual watchfulneſs. <hi>Cum aliquid conatu maximo ſtudioque cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum eſſe dicitur, vineae nomen ſupponitur; vinea pro maximo negotio ſumitur; &amp; ratio eſt, quia vinea aſsidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, perpetuum &amp; indefeſſum laborem Agricolae deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat:</hi> So it was uſed after a ſort perpetually for any hard and continued labour, as <hi>Horace</hi> hath it, l. 2. ep. 1. <hi>Vt vineta egomet caedam mea:</hi> and this is called pruning his own Vineyard; But this is a Metaphor moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put for the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. <hi>hire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into the Vineyard, Mat.</hi> 21.33,39.

Surely, they would never have placed them in authority that they were ſo angry with; they would have exalted ſome of their own ſpirit, and party as commonly the manner of men is; be they never ſo vile (which is one of the great abominations of the times and this age) and they by their power over the Vineyard could make Keepers who they would; they could ſet who they pleaſed over
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:168372:65"/> the Vineyard: Surely the meaning is this, they did themſelves witheraw the ſhoulder from the publick work, and left it in the Churches hands; that either they muſt now ſtick to it, or all muſt fall to the ground, and the Vineyard be wholly laid waſt; as for their part, the work was hazardous; they were to meet both with <hi>Foxes,</hi> and with <hi>a wild-Bore</hi> alſo, one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the graſs, but the other to root up the Vineyard; and therefore it is good to withdraw the hand, and let all be made waſte; let all former labours and coſt be loſt, and all the culture that hath been uſed about it, and let us forfeit all our hopes; though we have looked for fruit, yet let the enemy gather it, though the Vine-yard have been watered with blood at the root, which Hiſtorians ſay, is above all other, a means to make it fat and fruitful: If <hi>Gilead abide beyond Iordan, and</hi> Dan <hi>remained in ſhips,</hi> Reuben <hi>did hear the bleating of the flocks, and</hi> Aſher <hi>abode in his own beraches, and</hi> Iſſachar <hi>be couched between two burdens:</hi> in this caſe <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthali</hi> are by their brethren made Keepers of the Vineyard, for the burthen is laid upon their ſhoulders, or elſe all muſt be laid waſte, and all trodden down by the beaſts of the field, and ſo they did not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Rulers of the Vineyard; but the neceſſity that their brethren put upon them did it; and that this is the meaning, you may ſee by the word in the Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>Hence the obſervations are plainly three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Keepers of the Vineyard have more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly Vineyards of their own to keep; which is by God committed to them, of which they can ſay in a ſpecial manner, <hi>My Vineyard which is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, their keeping of the Vineyard may
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:168372:66"/> many times hinder them from keeping their own Vine; the care and imployment about the publick, though conſcienciouſly undertaken, yet may be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to a man from ſomething that doth more ſpecially concern him, and as a duty lie upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man cannot look upon his publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with comfort, if he do neglect his own vine: for it is that which the Church in the middle of all her publick imployments doth here bitterly complain of.</p>
               <div n="1" type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Keepers of the Vineyard have yet a more peculiar charge from God of their own Vineyards:</hi> There are two ſorts of Watchmen, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. <hi>the Watchmen that go about the City,</hi> and there are <hi>the Watchmen of the wall:</hi> and both are for the ſafety of the City, as here the Keepers of the Vineyard are, and the ſafety thereof; and I know its a high honour to be employed by God in ſuch a work, and therefore they have very eminent titles given unto them both in the Scripture; they are called <hi>the Angels of God,</hi> and they are for protection, <hi>they pitch their Tents about you, Rev.</hi> 2.1. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.17. they are <hi>fathers, Iob.</hi> 29.15. No men have more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable titles: <hi>pietatis &amp; poteſtatis nomen:</hi> A term of care and tenderneſs, as well as of authority and power; they are alſo <hi>the ſheilds of the earth, Pſal.</hi> 47. <hi>ult.</hi> and a ſhield is a kind of partition wall between a man and danger, all is for preſervation.

<pb n="599" facs="tcp:168372:66"/> of their own committed unto them by God to keep.</p>
                  <p>And this Vineyard that is committed unto perſons to keep, is two-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, keep thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, keep thy houſe. For they are in a ſpecial manner thy own Vineyard.</p>
                  <p>Firſt keep thy heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>above all keeping, keep thy heart:</hi> it was the great care of <hi>David, Let my heart be ſound in thy ſtatutes: I will run the way of thy Commandments when thou ſhalt inlarge my heart;</hi> and it was the grand honour of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>his heart was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with God;</hi> and it is made the pattern of his ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Governors that followed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was the grear comfort of <hi>Hezikiah</hi> when he came to dye, after he had ruled the people skilfully all his daies, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I have walked before thee with a perfect heart:</hi> and it is this that is the bitter reflexion upon all the good that <hi>Iehu</hi> had done after that glorious teſtimony of God to him, <hi>thou haſt done all that was right in mine eyes, and which was in my heart.</hi> 2 King. 10.30,31. <hi>but he took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And the grounds of it are theſe four.</p>
                  <p>Firſt this is properly your own: it is the ſoul is the darling, it is the ſoul is the man, it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that doth loſe his ſoul, is ſaid in another place to loſe himſelf. It is true that there is a great truſt committed unto a man in other things, but yet they are all but <hi>this worlds goods:</hi> a mans eſtate is no more, and a mans honour is no more: nay a mans inward gifts and abilities of his mind are no more: they do all dye with him; if there be <hi>tongues, they ſhall ceaſe, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:168372:67"/> it ſhall vaniſh away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12,13. Now if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be an engagement, as we do love perſons and things becauſe they are our own, <hi>Chriſt loved his own, he loved them unto the end,</hi> &amp;c. Surely there is nothing that is your own like unto your heart; <hi>therefore keep thy heart above all keepings;</hi> for if thou loſe thy ſoul, thou art a loſt man, and <hi>a Son</hi> of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this Vineyard above all others is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the moſt fought againſt. Firſt by ſin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. it is againſt the body and ſtate, and brings all plagues upon both, but it is eminenter againſt the ſoul, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.38. <hi>ſinners againſt their own ſouls;</hi> ſo that as it is really the act of the ſoul, the ſin of the ſoul; for ſin is in the ſoul as grace is; it is <hi>radicaliter in corde, &amp; redundanter in corpore,</hi> as ſin is mainly the act, <hi>Micha</hi> 6.8. <hi>the ſin of my ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. it is the miſchief of ſin which doth really light upon the ſoul, and it is to the prejudice thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Satan mainly fights againſt the ſoul, he is <hi>Abaddon, the deſtroyer,</hi> he ſeeks to devoure all the man. I, but its the ſoul that is the ſweet morſel that he doth continually with greedineſs gape after; he doth take away the word: it is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>leaſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and be converted:</hi> it is the converſion of the ſoul that he really is an enemy to and when he knows he can hinder the ſalvation of a ſoul, there is no ſuch pleaſure to him; for there is no walking in the narrow way without <hi>entering at the ſtraight gate;</hi> Satan is the envious one <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: now as the greateſt mercie is that of the ſoul; ſo the greateſt envy of Satan is that which reacheth unto the ſoul.</p>
                  <pb n="601" facs="tcp:168372:67"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, the main Judgements of God are upon the ſoul; as the greateſt bleſſings from God are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, ſo the greateſt Judgements from God are alſo ſpiritual; and that is, when he doth ſuffer the ſoul to proſper in a way of ſinning, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.11. <hi>they made them Altars to ſin:</hi> Altars ſhall be unto them to ſin. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na eſt ira quando peccantibus non iraſcitur Deus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ierom.</note> Jerom. <hi>Tu dixiſti Domine, &amp; ita eſt, ut omnis malus animus ſibi ipſi ſit poena:</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, anſwerable to the proſperity of the ſoul, ſo do all things elſe proſper; all proſperity is to be meaſured by it, <hi>oh.</hi> 3.2. So <hi>Paul</hi> did meaſure all his proſperitie, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> though <hi>his outward man did decay,</hi> ſo <hi>his inward man was renewed,</hi> it was that he could rejoyce in, becauſe he meaſured his proſperitie be that of his ſoul: and otherwiſe for a man to have an enate, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and a high place in the world, and to mount all the ſteps of honour, and to proſper in it, in waies of briberie and blood: all this is but that <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.15. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this will have a very great influence upon your government: and therefore keep this Vineyard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. <hi>ult.</hi> Magiſtrates are ſaid to be <hi>Shields of the earth,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>ſcuta Deo,</hi> as well as <hi>hominibus;</hi> to keep off the Judgements of God, to ſtand in the gap with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> who did this in a common ſlaughter and <hi>David</hi> in a publick famine <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is he like to prevall with God for a people, who hath neither
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:168372:68"/> communion with God nor intereſt in him? is he like to turn away Judgement who is every day inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in procuring it, and who is alſo to be fuel for the ſame conſuming fire? And in reſpect of men alſo, there is a power over the bodies and eſtates of men, and there is a power over their hearts and in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; and ſuch a one God doth give unto gracious Magiſtrates, as we ſee he gave his people of old, as <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. There is a double Image that a Magiſtrate muſt bear; an Image of God in him as a man, as well as upon him as a Magiſtrate; and the heart of men will ſtoop to them that are ſuch Magiſtrates: Let me tell you, It is not a Scepter, a Sword, nor a Mace, a Navy, nor an Army, that can long govern a Nation. An evil heart will deſtroy a mans wiſdom, and will blaſt his government, and make it unſucceſsful, whatever he be, though he be never ſo great a Polititian, and never ſo much admired and cryed up by men, yet if he be not a godly man, be ſhall not proſper: <hi>the Lord was with him, and whatever he did, he made it to proſper.</hi> I, that is the true ground of all ſucceſs in government: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſure keep your own Vineyard &amp;c. But you will ſay How ſhall we make our Government proſper? Take there directions</p>
                  <p>Firſt, keep a good conſcience <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>xerciſe my ſelf daily,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, to keep a conſcience void of offence.</hi> Government is a burdenſome thing, and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt hath the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon his ſhoulders, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. It is not barely work for the head only, wherein lies the ſtrength of the man; it is a great miſery to lay a great burden on a galled back. Do not live and be acted by principles without you, as the manner of men is; <hi>Perſius — Nec te

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, be you diligent in <hi>making of your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10 and indeed your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires it more then other mens, becauſe your ſervices and your hazards are greater then other mens: There are (as ſome obſerve) two caſes in which God doth give his people early aſſurance ſometimes, when he doth make others wait longer for it, for God doth diſpence aſſurance after the nature of temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, according to no ruled caſe, but in a priviledge way.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When he hath an intention men ſhall dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and therefore he will perfect their graces early.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when God hath great Services immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to employ men in after their converſion, which was the caſe of <hi>Paul.</hi> It is too much for any one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with dangers without, and terrors within at once, when a man carries his life in his hand, and if then the thoughts of eternitie ſeiſe upon him, and diſtract him in his way; but when a man can ſay, <hi>I know my Redeemer
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:168372:69"/> lives: and when this earthly houſe is diſſolved, I have a building not made with hands eternal in the heavens:</hi> and a man can with this light of the Lord walk through darkneſs; then the man can <hi>walk upon the high places of the earth, and his ſoul tread down ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, keep your ſouls conſtantly in waies of communion with the Lord; it is an excellent rule for Magiſtrates, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8 <hi>to do Iuſtice, and love mercy, and walk humbly with their God,</hi> that the unction of God may be upon your hearts as well as upon your offices, that you may be every day <hi>annointed with freſh oyl:</hi> ye have need of new direction every day anſwerable to your freſh occaſions and occurrences; and it is a happy thing when a Magiſtrate can go to God in a ſtraight, as <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Keilah, Lord, will</hi> Saul <hi>come down?</hi> I beſeech thee tell thy ſervant: and when there is a continual ſecret entercourſe between him and God, as 1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 9.15. <hi>and the Lord told</hi> Samuel <hi>in his ear;</hi> a man hath his <hi>urim</hi> and <hi>thummim</hi> to conſult with, an Oracle to go to from day to day; and you have need of new aſſiſtance and encouragements daily, anſwerable to the new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that do preſent themſelves, and ye are the <hi>nails</hi> upon which all the burthen hangs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.24. and therefore you had need be <hi>faſtned in a ſure place;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that which the Lord did promiſe unto Jeſus Chriſt when he did undertake the government of the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>I have called thee in righteouſneſs, I will hold thee by the hand, he ſhall not faile nor be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:</hi> and truly there is nothing in the world can do it, unleſs the Lord daily ſtretch <hi>a banner of love over you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, keep your ſelves from the ſins that do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:168372:69"/> attend high places and imployments, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.23. It is <hi>Davids</hi> great care to keep himſelf from his <hi>own iniquity:</hi> and they are commonly theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Pride, having <hi>your hearts lifted up above your brethren;</hi> it is a hard matter to keep a mans heart low in a high place, and to be like a ſpire-ſteeple, <hi>minimus in ſummo,</hi> ſmalleſt at top; for you are made of the ſame clay with other men: only, as it is with the rainbow, it is but a common wattery cloud, and only by reflection it is enameled; <hi>rara virtus eſt humilitas honorata.</hi>

<pb n="606" facs="tcp:168372:70"/> and when by their general walking and by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience you have in the judgement of charity ground to judge of it to be conſcience, and not will, nor humour; ſuppoſe it be an error or a want of light in ſome things in which their judgement is not truly informed, ſhall we not ſay, <hi>God will reveal even this unto them;</hi> See the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of God unto a froward child, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.7. <hi>I have ſeen his waies, and I will heal him,</hi> &amp;c. and of Chriſt to <hi>Thomas</hi> who was a little willful alſo in his unbelief. The complaint of old was under our former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, that if a wicked man had a dead member to be cut off, they did turn the back to the ſword of Juſtice: but if a Saint had but a hair to be pared off, then they did turn the edge of the ſword and ſtrike a full blow: let it not be ſo ſaid of you, when you rule over men, and thoſe your brethren, whoſe Repreſentatives you know you are, and profeſs your ſelves to lead by <hi>the cords of men,</hi> and the cords of love: <hi>amor neſcit cogi:</hi> for they will never give Governors a place in the hearts of men, <hi>Ezck,</hi> 34.18 <hi>I will judge between the fat and lean cattle: for the fat eat up the good paſture and tread down the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due; they drink of the good water, and they foul the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due with their fect,</hi> &amp;c. this doth provoke the Lord to come in to Judge between them, yea to feed them with Judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, let the Ordinances of God be ſet up in your family, that at leaſt if you cannot joyn unto other Churches, you may have a Church in your houſe, which was the honour of ſome of the private Saints in Scripture: <hi>Ahraham</hi> had <hi>his Catechiſed ſervants, Gen.</hi> 14.14. the Hebrew word is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, be diligent to know the ſtate of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and by conſequence in bewailing the ſins of it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27.23. <hi>be diligent to know the ſtate of thy flock, &amp; look well to thy herds: de diligenti rei familiaris adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one intelligitur:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cartwr.</note> Cartwright. Next unto the ſtate of a mans own heart, it is an evil to be a ſtranger to the ſtate of his own houſe; and a man ſhould be much in bewailing family evils and decaies, as we ſee it in <hi>David</hi> when he came to dye, <hi>though he make my houſe not to grow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For, there is a curſe on the families of men, and that curſe many times cleaves to the houſe, as we ſee it in the family of <hi>Ely,</hi> though a godly man; and of <hi>David, I will bring evil upon thy houſe,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>The Keepers of other Vineyards, do many times neglect their own Vineyards;</hi> See the inſtance of <hi>Iehu</hi> in the Magiſtracy, and of them in the miniſtery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7 we have propheſied in thy name, &amp; <hi>we have eat and drank in thy preſence, and in thy name have caſt out Devils:</hi> and we have done many mighty works for thee in the world.</p>
                  <p>Men employed in the higheſt affairs in Church and
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:168372:72"/> ſtate, and God hath uſed them as inſtruments of much good to others, yet they themſelves may be caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaies: and the reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, their imployments do take up their hearts: there is ſomething of the thorn in every earthly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and it ſucks the ſtrength of the ſoul, and a mans heart is apt to be drawn out inordinately to them, and to be over-ſhot into them, that there is no place for any thing elſe to grow there: and thoſe ſweet retirements of ſoul with God from day to day he is a ſtranger to, when he wakes and ſhould be with God: now a crowd of worldly affairs preſs in upon him, and ſo by this means his ſoul is drowned in them. It is ſtrange to obſerve the higheſt degrees of temporary Believers, and that is <hi>the thorny ground;</hi> they were men that had great works upon them, and were in high eſteem in the Church: men of great gifts and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and thoſe that had ſuffered much for God, and the Goſpel: and yet, <hi>licitis perimus omnes:</hi> they periſh in the unlawful uſe of lawful things: the creatures had taken up their hearts, and they were ſet upon them, and loſe their ſouls in the perſuite of them, and calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay down in their graves, and be caſt away in a calm before they are aware.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they do take off the heart; for <hi>pectora noſtra duas non admittentia curas;</hi> there can be no place; for, <hi>intus exiſtens prohibet alienum:</hi> when a mans heart goes out unto a thing, as <hi>Davids heart went out after Abſolom:</hi> and <hi>their hearts in Ezek.</hi> 31.33. <hi>went after their covetouſneſs;</hi> ſet it upon God, and duties often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but its attendance is taken off by the affairs to which it is accuſtomed.</p>
                  <p>There is that poyſon in the creature, it is not only
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:168372:72"/> deceiving, but its defiling, and there is that curſe unleſs a man be very watchful, that will creep upon him in all imployments about the creature whatſoever; the heart will be taken off from God thereby; there is a ſtrange kind of Idolatry, <hi>ſummus ſeculi reatus,</hi> that doth vent and diſcover it ſelf in the hearts of men in this kind, that the heart ſhall be taken off from duty whileſt he is in the way of duty, and a lower imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall dead his heart unto that which is higher and more excellent, and yet the man ſhall pleaſe and ſatisfie himſelf fully in the one, with the conſtant and daily neglect of the other; and yet this ſhall be given unto him as a Rattle to ſtil his conſcience if it cry, that he is called to publick employment; if he be diligent in that, he thinks he hath done enough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>a man that hath ſo neglected his own Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, cannot look upon it but with grief, notwithſtanding all his care of other Vineyards committed to his truſt and care;</hi> and it is a ſad thing in theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is ſaid to think how I have neglected the great duties for which I came into the world; it is true, you are to <hi>ſerve your generation by the will of God:</hi> and there is a reſpect unto God to be put upon your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt actions; <hi>Do all to the glory of God,</hi> and it is this bent of the heart through Chriſt that makes them to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of grace <hi>in ordine ſupernaturali:</hi> But yet though there be duties done to men wherein God is ſerved, yet the main of the man is to be laid out in the ſervice of God, and the duties between God and the mans own ſoul; <hi>walk in and out before the people, yet</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son, know the God of thy Fathers and ſerve him,</hi> &amp;c. it is ſad to ſee the great Commandment neglected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="612" facs="tcp:168372:73"/>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ſad to think how many precious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and advantages I have loſt: how many ſweet motions and admonitions of the ſpirit have I poſted unfruitfully over, and made the Lord to ſpeak in vain in ſweet illapſes of the Spirit: the Lord hath called upon me, but my worldly thoughts did lodge within me ſtill, and there was no place in my heart for ſuch calls from God, and inſinuations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely there is a way of enjoying God even in worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and God would never have put the ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that he might ſerve God in them to their own diſadvantage, that they ſhould have loſs of him by it: <hi>Enoch walked with God, and he begat ſons and daughters, Gen.</hi> 5.19. he did not retire and ſeparate himſelf from the affairs of this life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Angels that are imployed by Chriſt in the things of this world; for <hi>the ſpirit of the living creatures is in the wheels,</hi> and they are finite creatures and cannot be in a two-fold <hi>ubi</hi> at one and the ſame time, and yet they loſe nothing of the beatifical viſion all the time of their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but <hi>their Angels,</hi> yea even while they are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, <hi>behold the face of their Father who is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Mat.</hi> 18.10. and we need not loſe our viſion by our imployment, if the fault were not our own, and and therefore it is ſad, becauſe it is our own ſin that is the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is ſad to ſee ſo many glorious works rejected, and ſo much labour loſt, that ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto the mans account: as we ſee in <hi>Iehu,</hi> it was a great work and ſervice that he did: and ſo that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but yet neither of their ſervices ſtood upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in reference to an eternal acceptation: Now to ſee a wiſe Counſellor, and a Statiſt, and a valiant Souldier,
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:168372:73"/> and a painful miniſter lay out himſelf unto the utmoſt, and eat the bread of carefulneſs all his life time; and yet when he comes to give up an account, all is but a Cypher, becauſe his main work went not on, becauſe he took no care of his own Vineyard: therefore the Lord rejects his care of others: as one ſaies, <hi>Si mihi daretur optio, eligerem Chriſtiani ruſtici ſordidiſsimum &amp; maxime agreſte opus, prae omnibus victoriis &amp; triumphis</hi> Alexandri, <hi>Caeſaris,</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. for his work to be burnt, and the man to ſuffer loſs when he hath beſtowed a great deal of pains in the building of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is more ſad for the perſon to periſh, and after all this to be caſt away, that he that did ſave others, ſhould himſelf be deſtroyed: he that was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to ſave Kingdoms, and to ſettle Nations, that he himſelf ſhould periſh: and he that did caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſhould be himſelf condemned with the Devils: who would not pitty ſuch a man that had gone along with and acted with the better party all his life time, and ſeemed very induſtrious and zealous in it alſo, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did, and been active in reformation and reſolute, and yet the man caſt away, becauſe of the neglect of his own Vineyard: for as Heaven and Hell divide the world: ſo will Chriſt, and he is making preparation for it at the laſt day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.5. he will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity, with whom they ſeemed to have little acquaintance in times paſt: but the Lord will put every man thus in his own place, with thoſe of his own rank, whatever now he may ſeem to be a covering Cherub. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.14,16.</p>

                  <p>Now for the Lords ſake, I beſeech you, as you are
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:168372:74"/> made Keepers of the Vineyard, ſo be ſure that you do keep your own Vineyard; if you could ſettle the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in the moſt happy and flouriſhing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you could deſire, all this would be nothing to thee, thou ſhouldſt never ſee when God comes; for no man can receive benefit by others that keeps not his own Vineyard; let me tell you the ſweeteſt fruits that the ſoul ſeeds on all his life time, are thoſe that he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from his own Vine; and to quicken you to it, take but theſe few conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>ye muſt all appear before the Iudgement ſeat of Chriſt:</hi> as he told his friends when he came to dye, he ſhould not appear before God as a Doctor, but he ſhall be diſ-robed of all thoſe any further then they refer to his <hi>works done in his body;</hi> but as a man only he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and be Judged: death doth pluck the Princes Crown off his head, and the Iudges robes from off the back, and the Lord ſhall Iudge you <hi>without reſpect of perſons:</hi> not ſo much how you have kept others, but how your own Vineyard: <hi>tantus quiſque eſt quantus eſt apud deum:</hi> the Lord doth not value any man by his greatneſs, or place, or his honour, or his office, but as he is inſtrumental in ſervice, and as he did keep his own Vineyard.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a comfortable argument to ſuch a man, that he is placed in ſuch a publick imployment in mercy, if it doth not cauſe him to neglect his own Vineyard: and if he doth neglect it, it was in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he was placed there: that creature which doth draw the heart off from God and duty, was given in a curſe: and though it be a bleſſing in the thing yet it is a curſe to the man: if the <hi>table be a ſnare,</hi> its a curſe: <hi>Iratus dat amanti quod male amat:</hi> and ſo it is
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:168372:74"/> of imployments alſo: there is a difference between the graces of a condition and the gifts of it. <hi>Iudas</hi> had the one, and ſo had <hi>Saul:</hi> but it was <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had the other; and therefore the one might keep other Vineyards, but the other they alſo keep their own, and that was a token they were called in mercy; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thy heart neglects God, and thou grow remiſs in reference unto thy eternal eſtate, take heed this be not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to thee, and after all thy Religion, this is the time when God will turn thee off.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, know that if you neglect your own Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards as Magiſtrates, there is a Iudgement will come upon you: remember <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.10. Chriſt in his Iudgements will put no difference, he will lay you aſide as <hi>a veſſel in which there is no pleaſure, and caſt you out alſo as an abominable branch, Zach.</hi> 11.16. there is a Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned on Magiſtrates, <hi>thy right arm ſhall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thy right eye ſhall be put out:</hi> he ſhall loſe the gifts for government: for they be of that nature that they may decay and be utterly loſt, as it was with <hi>Saul</hi> when <hi>the Spirit of the Lord departed from him;</hi> and all his authority and ruling power with the people ſhall be taken away, and the place that he had before in the hearts of the people, he ſhall loſe for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if you periſh, there will be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing then at the downfall of any men in the world: therefore do not gratifie the enemies ſo much, that <hi>watch for your halting:</hi> and with Triumph the enemy will ſay, <hi>How is the hammer of the earth broken?</hi> you that God hath made victorious, and you have ſet your foot upon the necks of your enemies; yea how would Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan rejoyce at ſuch a fall, and all the damned ſpirits would ſport themſelves as it were, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.9,10. <hi>art
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:168372:75"/> thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer the ſon of the morning,</hi> &amp;c. and there are no men in the world that will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with ſo much ſhame and confuſion of face as you will do if the Lord reject you: Therefore to conclude all, ſuffer this word of exhortation: ſeeing <hi>your mothers children have made you Keepers of the Vineyard,</hi> look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that charge, and let it not be neglected; for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Nations will be dreadful when you come to <hi>give an account of your Steward-ſhip:</hi> but however, <hi>above all keepings, keep your own Vineyard.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere <hi>Ioſhua</hi> a holy man, and a godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, is to undertake a great ſervice; he was <hi>to divide unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>the Land of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan <hi>for an inheritance, which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto their Fathers to give them.</hi> But great duties are commonly beſet with great difficulties; therefore the heart of a man muſt have ſomething to bear it up
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:168372:76"/> that is ſtronger then it ſelf: <hi>ſuffultum eſt cor meum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>my heart is under-propped, Pſal.</hi> 112.8. there is a double courage: both which we find in <hi>Ioſhua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, more particular in reference unto a ſervice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and that is a courage in ventering upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: <hi>for the ſons of</hi> Anak <hi>be there, and their Cities wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to heaven:</hi> they are a mighty warlike people, and in poſſeſſion, and fortified: <hi>Yet be ſtrong, for I have commanded thee;</hi> there is a particular faith or conſidence that the Spirit puts into the hearts of the Saints: and this particular faith works from a particular courage, that though weak, yet by faith are made ſtrong and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come valiant in fight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and with this God gives to his people two things, as <hi>Plut.</hi> ſaith were in <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, Plurimum andaciae ad capienda pericula; &amp; plurimum Conſilii inter pericula ipſa:</hi> he was bold in attempting, and yet wiſe in managing of the moſt difficult ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; his courage wrought not raſhneſs in him, nor his counſel wrought not ſlothfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a more particular courage in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to duty: <hi>be very couragious, and obſerve to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto all that the Lord commanded thee:</hi> difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and dangers are properly the objects of courage; and many a man may be as couragious as a Lyon in a particular ſervice, and yet when he comes, <hi>to obſerve all that is commanded,</hi> in point of duty, his heart may fail him: men daring in dangers, are many times men fainting in duty; many a man in a particular ſervice may have his heart with <hi>Iehu</hi> as an Adamant, to deſtroy all the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> &amp;c. but yet when he comes to a general obedience, he is as weak as water; for <hi>Iehu took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his heart:</hi> there are duties that are diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:168372:76"/> and a man muſt go alone; <hi>at my firſt anſwer no man ſtood with me, all men forſook me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet then a man muſt not forſake the ſervice he is doing, either for God or his people; and there are ſome duties which lie upon a man, and which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes, that enemies may oppoſe and obſerve him in, as they did <hi>Daniel;</hi> yet he would venter his life to gain an hour at prayer; and there are ſome duties that a man may with courage reſiſt enemies in, and conquer all their oppoſition, yet he may be betrayed by his friends: as we ſee in <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.7. <hi>there were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him vain men, children of</hi> Belial, <hi>and they ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened themſelves againſt him, but it was when he was young,</hi> (and yet he was fourtie years old) <hi>but he was young and tender-hearted, and could not withſtand them:</hi> ſo alſo it is ſaid of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> that <hi>the men of his peace ſet him on and prevailed againſt him,</hi> &amp;c. they that no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could conquer, have been overcome by their friends; wild counſellors they will prove ill friends: and <hi>thy feet will ſink in the mire, and they will turn away back:</hi> they will leave thee to ſhift for thy ſelf in the greateſt of thy ſtreights, nay they will be the worſt enemies againſt thee; as an Ivy twiſts about an Oak, and lives by the ſap of it, but he hath a root of his own, and yet by his embraces he eats out the heart of it, and he doth flouriſh and grow green, but the Oak doth wither, who is thus imbraced and loſeth its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure from day to day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the rule of this courage muſt be the Law: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution without a rule, is like a horſe without a bridle, which hath no reſtraint; its running well but out of the way: and it muſt be according to the Law known, and rightly underſtood, for <hi>he muſt meditate therein day
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:168372:77"/> and night; it muſt dwell richly in him</hi> that is in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: it muſt not be <hi>the Law unlorded, Mat.</hi> 15.6. the word is in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>not by the traditions of men,</hi> nor by the frenzies and inſpirations of men: for there is a kind of myſtical Divinity that is brought forth by men, that cannot be contented <hi>to be wiſe according unto what is written;</hi> that turn all the Scripture into fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Allegories, and far fetched imaginations: there <hi>is wiſdom from beneath,</hi> and there is inſpirations from Hell, when <hi>Satan will transform himſelf like an Angel of light,</hi> as well as there is inſpirations from heaven: but let me tell you, we muſt know no Law within us, but that which is derived from the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and anſwers to it as the Counterpain to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and we muſt know no other <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>he that was born at Bethlem;</hi> and <hi>was crucified at Ieruſalem:</hi> and <hi>no other Antichriſt but myſtical Babylon the mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, which is the City that rules over the Kings of the earth;</hi> and to ſpeak of another ſpiritual Chriſt and Antichriſt, apart from theſe, and ſo to turn all into fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, this is not the Law as delivered by God, but as framed by men whoſe fancies go beyond their faith, and their pride exceeds them both.</p>
               <p>And this Law he ſhould not only have in his heart and in his eye, but he ſhould have it alwaies in his mouth; he is not to depart from thence; <hi>non tantum ſibi privatim, ſed toti populo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The knowledge that he hath of the Law of God, he ſhould hold forth to the people in his government, and let him profeſs the truth which he doth believe; the ſame duty lies upon him, both as a Magiſtrate and as a man: or elſe, <hi>the ten Kings</hi> could never as Kings, <hi>deſtroy the whore;</hi> elſe as a Magiſtrate let him never be
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:168372:77"/> called Chriſtian, if he bear not the teſtimony of Chriſt; let him be Chriſtian as a man, if he do profeſs Chriſt; but let him not be ſo as a Magiſtrate, that thinks he is born to do no more for Chriſt under whom he acts, then a Pagan is: All Magiſtracy came in by ſin: <hi>nomen iſtud culpa meruit, &amp; non natura:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Luther.</note> A natural ſubjection there ſhould have been, but no civil ſubjection of one man to another; and it is by Jeſus Chriſt after the fall, the government being put into his hands, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.15,16. <hi>by me Kings raign;</hi> it is not ſpoken of Chriſt barely as God, but as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in a Covenant, and Decree: ſo that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Nations belongs to him, <hi>he is King of Kings;</hi> and they that will ſerve him muſt not only do his work, but ſerve his end: now his end is that the Providential Kingdom be ſubordinate to the Spiritual, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> and that muſt be their aim alſo, or elſe they will never be accepted of Chriſt: as we ſee it in <hi>Iehu:</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great ſervices he did, yet becauſe his end was not Gods, therefore they were not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>We come not to Magiſtrates for a Confeſſion of faith in this, as if the Goſpel had not ſtrength enough of it ſelf to defend it: there was a time when Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates were not Chriſtian and yet the Goſpel wanted not its defence: and when the Magiſtrate is Chriſtian, we know <hi>Diabolus nondum factus eſt Chriſtianus,</hi>

<pb n="622" facs="tcp:168372:78"/> the Nations good, becauſe we know that the ſoul of the Lord will be diſ-joynted by theſe means, we ſhould never ſo much as move you in this kind: for we know, <hi>that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>Neither is profeſſion enough, but there muſt be an anſwerable practice: the Magiſtrate muſt <hi>obſerve to do all that is commanded therein:</hi> it is obedience that is the life of the Law: he muſt <hi>be ready to do every good work:</hi> without practice the Law is but a dead letter to a man: and it is the fruit of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>created in Chriſt unto good works:</hi> dead works flow from a dead man; a man that is living will act lively; and its the glory of our profeſſion, <hi>let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works,</hi> &amp;c. If we ſpeak never ſo high and Angelical, yet <hi>if our converſation be not in heaven,</hi> we do nothing our waies are in hell, when our words ſeem to be in heaven: the Angels and thoſe that ſtand by, they receive that they may do: <hi>they go and come

               <p>And the fruit of all this is, <hi>that thou maiſt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs:</hi> the words have many efficacies; <hi>proſperous,</hi> that is, to have all things go well with him: and his undertaking to anſwer his deſign: whereas many times it doth not, but the contrary: and <hi>the counſels of wiſe men are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed backwards:</hi> and though they conceive one thing, yet another is brought forth: it is as the Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p>Firſt, this is the way to walk by an un-erring rule: let me tell you, the policies of men will deceive you, for they do many times deceive themſelves: <hi>the wiſe are taken in their own craft, and burnt as Bees in their own hives;</hi> and the Devil doth commonly make uſe of <hi>the wiſdom of the wiſe;</hi> alſo <hi>cupit &amp; diabolus,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Secondly, this is the only vvay to rule with God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.12. they rule for God; <hi>ye Iudge not for men, but for the Lord:</hi> and it is a great happineſs to have God rule with them: there are tvvo great Judgements that in a ſpecial manner vve ſhould fear: the one is to have God to depart from our Magiſtrates, and the other from our Ordinances, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.6,7.

                  <p>Firſt, between God and the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, between the Magiſtrate and the people: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.17. <hi>between the Lord and the King and the people, that they ſhould be the Lords people: likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the people:</hi> So that a people coming under the authority of men, and <hi>obeying them for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake,</hi> it is ſtill with reſpect unto the authority of God, that they will ſo be under government, as they
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:168372:79"/> wil be the <hi>Lords people</hi> ſtill; &amp; therefore the care of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould be, not only that they rule in a way of providence, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. but in a way of grace, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Caeſar, ſed Deo minor;</hi> and whileſt the Magiſtrate rules according to the word of God, and hath reſpect to it in his Government, ſo long God rules in and with the Magiſtrate, and therefore all that he doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſhall proſper.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this is the only way to have the ſpirit to be their guide in Government: he hath undertaken to his people to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this is the way to come under the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſpect of many gracious promiſes of ſucceſs and proſperitie in your undertakings and adminiſtrations, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Keep the charge of the Lord thy God, his Statutes, his Commandments, his Judgements, his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that thou mayſt proſper in all that thou doeſt, and whitherſoever thou turneſt thy ſelf,</hi> 2 Chron. 22.13. <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord give thee wiſdom, that thou mayſt keep the Law of the Lord thy God: then ſhalt thou proſper, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Chron. 24.20. <hi>Zachary</hi> was <hi>cloathed with the ſpirit:</hi> and he had need be ſo, that ſpeaks to an apoſtatizing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie,

                  <p>Firſt, in the Doctrine of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the worſhip it holds forth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in practice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for Doctrine: Let the word be alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, that you may receive it, and give a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to it: there is <hi>a form of Doctrine, a pattern of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words:</hi> there is a <hi>perſonal foundation,</hi> and there is a <hi>doctrinal foundation, Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. which the Saints ought to build upon; &amp; all the <hi>ſuperſtructures,</hi> let them be for clearing the truth and eſtabliſhing, not for ſubverting of the faith: <hi>Sit profectus fidei, non permutatio;</hi> under perſecution Satan acted another part; <hi>Cogit homines negare Chriſtum, nunc docet:</hi>

                  <p>Here are three things that I ſhall ſpeak to.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the great intereſt Chriſt hath in the world is Truth. Firſt, it is that by which Chriſt rules and conquers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.2. Secondly, it is that upon which the Church ſtands, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. Churches are ſaid to be the great intereſt of Chriſt in the world: and indeed it is true, that for the Saints ſake, and the Churches ſake, the world ſtands; but he now that would deſtroy truth, overthrows the foundation upon which the Church is built: we ſpeak of perſecution, and there is a great cry of perſecution; but the greateſt perſecution that ever was or can be to the Church, was not in deſtroying their perſons, but in over-throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truths upon which the Church is built: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hereticks have been the greateſt perſecutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, truth is that by which holineſs is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>ſanctifie them by thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> Now for men to cry up holineſs, and decry truth, it is <hi>oppoſitio in adjecto:</hi> the Lord loves his people, but he loves his truth above all; and it is dangerous to ſet a mans ſelf againſt that which Chriſt ſpecially will own and advance, <hi>he hath exalted his word above all his name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, no Nation did ever proſper, that did ever ſet themſelves againſt Truth; and no Magiſtrates did ever proſper in their Government, that did ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Truths, and did countenance and favour them that did it: to give you a few inſtances: Firſt, conſider, the Jews Idolatry before their captivity, was their great ſin: but afterward they departed; <hi>Non prius facti ſint haeretici quam eſſe Idololatrae deſtiſſent:</hi> then here ſies ſprung up; and it will appear that their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of truth, and ſuffering theſe to get ground,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:168372:81"/> and make merchandize of the people, was the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City, rather then the Army of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> that came againſt them, as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> &amp;c. The Rulers, they favoured thoſe that oppoſed Truth, and did aide themſelves, and took their parts, and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them: the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it was the flood: the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie their Emperours favoured it, and taking part with them that brought in the <hi>Goths</hi> and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations upon them, and extinguiſhed all the glory of their antient Government: the <hi>Star worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> in <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> falling from heaven: And the Eaſtern part, the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia, the Doctrine of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans,</hi> and <hi>the doctrine of the woman Iezebel,</hi> brought the <hi>Saracens</hi> upon them: I might inſtance in many other; but here at home though there was a perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before, and it may be in regard of reſtraint, as great well nigh as was afterward, but yet their ſins never came to a ripeneſs till they did begin <hi>to make void the Law of God,</hi> and labour to bring in the Doctrine of Poperie amongſt us, and Arminianiſm; and the Rulers took part with them, and favoured the Doctrine, and Teachers: and that brought in corrupt worſhip, and this filled their meaſure, and then did God awaken the ſouls of his ſervants to cry to him; and indeed, <hi>what can the righteous do when the foundations are deſtroyed?</hi> and the Lord was pleaſed to hear and to awake: when men in authority will favour and countenance thoſe that endeavour to overthrow truth, then God will pour contempt upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if there were no more but this, it will clear it, that the Churches are the great intereſt of Nations which have been formerly: and if deſtroying of the truths of God be the greateſt perſecution of Churches that can be, and the
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:168372:81"/> greateſt wrong that is done or can be done unto them, and let the Churches be corrupted, let me tell you, <hi>the end will be with a flood:</hi> they were the ſins of the ſons of God that in a ſpecial manner brought the flood upon the world.</p>
                  <p>We may ſpeak of Poperie, and cry out of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: but for the <hi>Antichriſt that denyes the Father and the Son,</hi> that they never did directly, but conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially: and yet if the main Doctrine of Antichriſt be received, favoured and countenanced, and the Teachers of them, ſurely the greateſt part of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is amongſt us: <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks of one <hi>Peter Aboliardus</hi> in his time, <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                     <hi>Cum de Trinitate loquitur ſapit</hi> Arius: <hi>cum de gratia</hi> Pelagius: <hi>cum de perſona Chriſti</hi> Neſtorius. There are ſome men that are nothing elſe, all their Religion is a bundle of old and abſolete he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not this to ſtir you up to an impoſition of Doctrines upon the conſciences of men, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly objected, and that all our dictates muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: a liberty and an indulgence I pray you to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in thoſe things wherein it may be granted: but a bounding of mens ſpirits by the word, is not bounding of the ſpirit, &amp; an impoſing thoſe things, at leaſt not to be diſputed, which the Scripture ſaith without the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of them men cannot be ſaved, this is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous impoſition: but yet this I preſs not, but only that as you are in authority, you would not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch Teachers, and that you would give your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony unto the truths of God, and let the Nation, yea all the Nations of the earth know, that you are not <hi>departed from the faith to follow ſuch lying vanities;</hi> and this ſhould I look upon as a glorious anſwer of the
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:168372:82"/> prayers of this day, and that you do not involve your ſelves and the Nation in the ruine of theſe things threatned and feared in the judgement of moſt that are godly and conſidering Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence alſo I cannot but infer, that they are the greateſt enemies unto the Church of God, and to any Nation, that do endeavour to corrupt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Religion, and are to be looked upon as ſuch; though they may be men of great parts, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for a State intereſt uſeful; yet if the bent of their ſpirits do run out this way, to corrupt the Doctrines of godlineſs, &amp; to oppoſe and decry them that do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, let me tell you, all the ſervice that they can do you, will not countervail this loſs; for though they may be cryed up for Saints, yet theſe are the great Engineers for Satan in the world: as <hi>Iraeneus</hi> hath a ſtory of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> whom he calls, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Iraeneus.</note> and they are the greateſt deſigners for Popery: I will not ſay it is <hi>finis operantis,</hi> but <hi>operis</hi> it is: as <hi>Contzen</hi> the Jeſuite, <hi>Error cui patrocinium deerit, ſine pugna con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidet:</hi> This I ſpeak as that which I am perſwaded in my conſcience will and doth provoke God both againſt you and your Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, keep cloſe to the word in the matter of worſhip: ſervices tendred unto God muſt <hi>be word-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi> and if not, you will never proſper: for elſe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is <hi>worſhiping of Devils,</hi> and not God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20. Now to bring in worſhiping of Devils amongſt you and not God, will be that which will cauſe the Lord to depart from you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is <hi>an image of Idolatry:</hi> and ſo much the greater, if there be <hi>a hand of the antients of Iſrael
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:168372:82"/> in it, Ezek.</hi> 8.3. it will provoke God to depart from a Nation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this hath deſtroyed the moſt flouriſhing Churches and Nations, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.5,6. <hi>Thy Calf Oh</hi> Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria <hi>hath caſt thee off,</hi> &amp;c. and the Eaſtern part of the Empire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20. It was their Idolatry in worſhip that did it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it will bring vengeance upon the Nations as well as on the Churches, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.7. <hi>They have ſown wind, and reapt the whirl-wind: Ezek.</hi> 10.2. <hi>fire from the Altar, and ſcattered over the City,</hi> it burns the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.20. <hi>I will pluck you up by the roots out of the Land,</hi> ſaies God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, keep cloſe to the word in point of practiſe alſo: perſonal holineſs the Lord requires of them that would proſper in their way, and have God with them in their Government. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24,25. they had ſet up a new Government, and the Lord had anſwered their deſires; I but he ſaith, <hi>fear the Lord, and ſerve him in truth, and with all your hearts, and conſider how great things the Lord hath done for you: but if you ſhall ſtill do wickedly,</hi> &amp;c. there the wickedneſs of a people indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Magiſtrate, will bring a Judgement upon the Government, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.5,7. <hi>if thou ſhalt walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me as</hi> David <hi>thy Father walked, in integrity of heart, then,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here you ſee the Apoſtacy of the Governors will bring a Judgement upon the Nation, nay though it be but a perſonal Apoſtacy: hear, and fear, and tremble, you that are the Rulers of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is the way to get you honour in the hearts of men when you reform your lives: <hi>purifie your hearts,</hi> and your houſes as well as your hearts;
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:168372:83"/> there is a double image that the Magiſtrate muſt gain authority by, an Image in you as men, as well as upon you as Magiſtrates: <hi>the Elders were crowned, and alſo cloathed with white garments, Rev.</hi> 4.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, not keeping cloſe to the word in point of practice, is the way to provoke God to lay you aſide, and not to delight in you: he loves <hi>veſſels fitted for the Maſters uſe;</hi> when you are faithful to God in waies of holineſs, as well as unto the Nation in waies of Juſtice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.2. <hi>And I took unto me faithful witneſſes to record,</hi> Uriah <hi>the Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c. A man may be faithful in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging ſome truſt put upon him by men, but yet be unfaithful to God in waies of holineſs: <hi>Contah was a deſpiſed broken Idol, a veſſel in whom God had no pleaſure,</hi> one that God will ſet himſelf to diſgrace; <hi>God will pour out contempt upon Princes,</hi> and all ungodly Magiſtrates; and if you alſo walk unholily, there will be a ſhame poured upon all your glory: they muſt <hi>be called, and faithful, and choſen,</hi> that God will delight to uſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Judgement upon <hi>Shebna,</hi> he and all his lumber was caſt down, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.16,17,18. if men in authority be vain-glorious and ſelf-ſeeking, though they have made many men their creatures, and raiſed parties to ſtrengthen their intereſt, God will ſweep away all ſuch rubbiſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this will be a teſtimony to you, if you walk holily and faithfully, that you are called to the imployment in mercy and not in wrath, if the graces of the condition God hath placed you in be exerciſed: indeed a man may exerciſe parts and gifts, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>at doth not make a man acceptable in the ſight of God: if the imployment a man is in do draw out and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his corruption, certainly it was in wrath, not in
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:168372:83"/> mercy that he was placed in it: therefore <hi>Remember your firſt love,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3,5,6. walk in your firſt waies, that yee may have an intereſt in God to attain mercy from him for your ſelves and for the people: Oh how powerful would the prayers of gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates be? and how able are they, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <hi>to ſtand in the gap, and to turn away wrath:</hi> they are the <hi>ſhields of the earth, Pſal.</hi> 47.9. and they are to be <hi>ſcuta Deo &amp; hominibus,</hi> to keep off Judgements from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon the people from God, as well as violences one from another: and can a man do that? can he think to turn off wrath from a Nation, who doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Judgement upon himſelf daily, and is in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all danger of it? And if there be any amongſt you that are unſound-hearted under all your ſhews, the Lord will diſcover you; for, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.30. <hi>He will not have the hypocrite raign, leſt the people be enſnared:</hi> the word ſignifies a man that walks in a cloud, or hath an artificial covering, that men may not ſee and obſerve his ſteps: God hates ſuch men in authority, and for his peoples ſake he will not have them raign: therefore let me exhort you to be ſincere and truly holy in your own perſons: many of you have been judged ſo to be; continue in it, manifeſt it, let it appear that you are better by authority, not worſe: you are called <hi>Gods upon earth;</hi> Oh how unworthy the name of a God will ſuch be? A drunken God, an unclean covetous God? <hi>&amp;c. Oh let ſuch things be not ſo much as named amongst you,</hi> but with abhorrency, as becomes Saints: ſee to whom the promiſe of protection is made, and of exaltation alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.15. <hi>he that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, he that deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſsion, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that ſtoppeth his
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:168372:84"/> ears from hearing of blood, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, he ſhall dwell on high, and the place of his defence ſhall be the munitions of Rocks: bread ſhall be given him, and his waters ſhall be ſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Ile add but a few conſiderations, a little to quicken you to this duty. Ile but name them.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, firſt the mercies that you have received, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.10. a people purchaſed with mercy, <hi>redeemed with a mighty hand; ſaved, yea with great ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the opportunities you have had, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. opportunity is a price, <hi>talentum maximum:</hi> there is a time when <hi>the Angels ſtir the waters:</hi> and if you miſs an opportunitie of doing good, God may never honour you with one again.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, remember the promiſes that you have made in the daies of your diſtreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What have you held forth to the Nation, nay to all the world, <hi>with hands lifted up to the moſt high;</hi> and vowed the endeavour of a reformation; and <hi>it is a ſnare after vows to make enquiry;</hi> the delay of a vow was viſited upon <hi>Iacob</hi> twentie years after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider the expectation of the Nations: all the eyes of the Saints all the world over are upon you, and they look what you will do: God hath made your cauſe leading; let not your example hinder them that follow you in the way that you have gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it will be a mighty teſtimony of your up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, that your heart is for God, and that you are ſet againſt evil things &amp; perſons, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 139.21,22. <hi>David</hi> appeals to God in it: Oh that many of you could do ſo, as he ſaid, <hi>amicum amo in Deo, inimicum propter deum:</hi> they are your corruptions that are ſnares both to you and the Nation.</p>
                  <pb n="635" facs="tcp:168372:84"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, what account can you give to God? <hi>you muſt all appear before God, and come to Judgement: and to whom much is given, of him much ſhall be required:</hi> and they can never give an account to God in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that cannot give an account before hand unto the Word by which they ſhall be Judged: This is the way to proſper, and <hi>that the fear of you may fall upon all the Land that you ſhall tread upon,</hi> as the promiſe is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.25. God gives men favour many times in the ſight of their enemies, and he makes them a fear to all round about them: and by this you ſhall eſtabliſh the Government that you have begun, and God ſhall give you in the hearts of his people, and ye ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in whatſoever you take in hand, <hi>then ſhall you make your way proſperous, then ſhall you have good ſucceſs.</hi>

So that there is a ſubordination and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviencie inſtrumentally in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is a choſen ſervant; the Lord had a work to do that was extraordinary, that men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels his ordinary ſervants could not perform; and that is to bring the creature as fallen from God, to God again, in reconciliation and Communion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord muſt raiſe up a new ſervant of purpoſe, who only could do this great work: and therefore the word is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Temple was the type of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. there was no ſervice to be done in the Temple, but there were all manner of neceſſary utenſils for it; there were <hi>Altars, Lavers, Cenſors and Snuffers,</hi> &amp;c. to ſhew that Chriſt the ſpiritual Temple was himſelf furniſhed with whatever was neceſſary for the ſervice required of him, to be performed by him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.17. <hi>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand:</hi> which is expounded three waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as an expreſſion of ſpecial love and favour, ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> called his youngeſt ſon, <hi>Benjamin the ſon of my right hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is an expreſſion of ſpecial honour: <hi>Solomon did ſet his mother at his right hand;</hi> and ſo Chriſt glorified in heaven, is ſaid to <hi>ſit down at the right hand of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, an expreſſion of inſtrumentality; the right hand being the main inſtrument of action, therefore Chriſt being deareſt to God, becauſe moſt ſervicable; in this reſpect Chriſt may be well ſtiled, <hi>the man of Gods right hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how came Chirſt to be a ſervant? Servants are of two ſorts. Firſt, <hi>nati,</hi> ſome are <hi>ad mancipium nati,</hi> born ſervants, as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> for <hi>partus ſequitur ventrem,</hi> and therefore was <hi>a bond-man. Gal.</hi> 4. Hence it is,
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:168372:87"/> he is made the type of all uuregenerate men; the two mothers are the two Covenants; <hi>Iſaac</hi> theſon of the one, a type of the regenerate: <hi>Iſhmael</hi> of the unregenerate, who are born ſlaves, becauſe they are born under a broken Covenant; Hence is that Covenant ſaid, <hi>To gender to bondage.</hi> Secondly, <hi>facti,</hi> ſome are made, and that alſo two waies. Firſt, by conſtraint, or by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, or by conqueſt; and in al theſe waies the creatures are ſervants to Chriſt. Secondly, by conſent, when one being <hi>ſui juris,</hi> doth freely and willingly conſent and enter into Covenant with another, to yield up his will unto him, to do his work, and to be ſubſervient unto his ends: Now Chriſt was not born a ſervant, for <hi>he was the only begotten Son of God.</hi> There is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſervice introduced by ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a ſervice of men to Satan, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>to be led Captive by him at his pleaſure;</hi> and in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as a God, to worſhip him: hence he became <hi>the God of this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that civil ſubjection of one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there was a Dominion that man had over all the other creatures: and there was a natural ſubjection of children to their parents: but a civil ſubjection of man to man came in by ſin, by the curſe: <hi>Nomen illud culpa meruit non natura,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> 
                     <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt as Mediator becomes a ſervant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the Father; had man ſtood, all the creatures had been every way fit for the ends for which they were created, and they would have anſwered Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in them all; but when ſin came into the world, there is now a new work to do, to raiſe up the decaies of mankind, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to take away ſin,</hi> and let the ſinner live: and this no creature in heaven or earth was
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:168372:88"/> fit for: the Lord muſt make a new ſervant, raiſe one a purpoſe for it, and unto this Chriſt did give conſent freely and willingly: <hi>he took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Phil.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>he ſaith, Loe I come to do thy work O God,</hi> &amp;c. Now that it may appear there was in him ſuch an inſtrumental fitneſs for all God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ends, we muſt examine what theſe ends are for which he is appointed: and they are of two ſorts. Firſt, principal. Secondly, additional and over-plus ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the principal ends are four: two of them are in reſpect of God, and two of them are in reſpect of man. Firſt, in reſpect of God. Firſt, the higheſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of all his glorious excellencies; the Lord had ſhewed forth much of himſelf before, but he will now ſet forth a new <hi>Syſtem</hi> of all his attributes, and he will ſo manifeſt them in Chriſt, as they were never known before: and if he had created millions of ſons, they would never have been ſo fit inſtruments for the manifeſtation of God as Chriſt is. Firſt, God had ſhewed much wiſdom before in the creation of the world, but much more in its reparation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now to take away ſin, and let the ſinner live, ſin damned and the ſinner ſaved, and that by ſo unimaginable a way as by the ſecond perſon to be made fleſh, it is that which the Angels admire and ſtudy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God had before ſhewed a great deal of mercy and goodneſs to the creature, making him <hi>after his own Image,</hi> and entred into Covenant with him: but for to take up a creature into perſonal union with himſelf, and to make up one perſon, and he never to put off that clay again for ever: how great is this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
                  <pb n="643" facs="tcp:168372:88"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, God had ſhewed much Juſtice before, both upon Angels and men: but all this was but Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on creatures, yea guilty creatures; now Gods Juſtice is far greater: he will not ſpare his ſon when ſin was but imputed, and it is ſaid, <hi>he delighted to grinde him to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the word in the Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. as the word is uſed, to beat a thing in a morter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt act both of mercy and Juſtice, that he did not ſpare his ſon, that we might thereby be freed from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it was the higheſt act of ſoveraignty; he had an abſolute ſoveraignty over all the creation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: he gives what Law he will, and appoints to what end he will: but for the Son to become a ſervant, he <hi>that thought it no robberie to be equal with God, and yet to take upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. and to be <hi>made under the Law,</hi> herein the ſoveraignty of God was marvellouſly declared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore if God will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf unto the world, there is more ſeen of him in Chriſt then can be in all the creatures in heaven and earrh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for Communication of himſelf in the higheſt way. Now this is the higheſt way of all other: for the ground of Communication is union: and the higher the union is, the more glorious the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Now the Lord having taken the Lord Chriſt into the higheſt union with the God-head, there muſt needs be the fulleſt Communication, and ſo God will diſpenſe nothing unto the creatures but by the ſon, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.11. and the more abundantly the Lord doth communicate himſelf unto Chriſt, the more gloriouſly will Chriſt communicate himſelf unto us; for he hath made him <hi>the ſecond Adam,</hi> A publick perſon, a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:168372:89"/> a common Treaſury, and by him he will diſpenſe himſelf to us; therefore in reſpect of God the Father, whether we conſider Gods intention by manifeſtation, or ſelf-communication, Chriſt is the fitteſt Inſtrument to accompliſh Gods ends in reſpect of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in reſpect of us, and ſo Gods ends are ſet down, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14. <hi>peace and good will towards men:</hi> reconciliation and communion; and there is a fitneſs in Chriſt for them both.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for reconciliation; there muſt be ſatisfaction given unto God, ſomething anſwerable to the wrong that God hath ſuſtained by ſin; for it muſt be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for if he will make the peace, he muſt pay the debt; and this none was able to do but Chriſt. Conſider, ſin hath wronged God in point of goods, and hath deſtroyed all the creatures; but Chriſt hath a world to lay down, for <hi>he is heir of all things,</hi> he is <hi>haeres natus,</hi> and he laies down his natural right, and takes it by a new title, as it were, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. he is become <hi>haeres conſtitutus, an heir appointed,</hi> &amp;c. Sin did wrong God in point of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it took away the ſervice of all the creatures from him, but now Jeſus Chriſt becoming a ſervant, he can do God more ſervice then all men or Angels could have done to eternity, and that in a higher and far more glorious way: and ſin did alſo wrong God in point of honour; and there it is impoſſible for a creature to make ſatisfaction. If all the Stars ſhould be Ecclipſed, they do never anſwer an Ecclipſe of the Sun, it is nothing in compariſon of the Suns Ecclipſe; but if the Sun ſhould be contented to be Ecclipſed, as Chriſt <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> he who in glory <hi>thought it no robberie to be equal with him:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.2. he <hi>had a glory with God before the world was:</hi> and he did lay,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:168372:89"/> down this glory for a time, and now he having finiſhed his work in the daies of his humiliation, he deſires that it may be reſtored to him again, <hi>glorifie me with that glory which I had with thee before the world was:</hi> for upon earth he had emptied himſelf, and <hi>took upon him the form of a ſervant; ſatisfactio eſt redditio aequivalentis;</hi> but this no creature could do, and therefore none could make peace for us, or ever accompliſh Gods end in our reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God will take man alſo into Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with himſelf; man is <hi>Non ſolum inſtauratus, ſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioratus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> 
                     <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And there is none can do it but Chriſt having once paid the debt, and received his diſcharge, <hi>the Angel rolled away the ſtone,</hi> as a publike Officer, to let him out of priſon; he went unto the Father, <hi>and ſate down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> and he that is gone ſo neer unto God who is <hi>the Son of his love,</hi> that lies in his boſom, which is the ſeat of ſecrets, and of love, who can give us Communion with him, and bring us unto the Father but he? <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. we have a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Who can give Son-ſhip, but he that is the Son? and who can give an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but he that is the heir? who can renew our Image, but he that is <hi>the Image of the Father?</hi> and who can ſet us at the right hand of God, but he that is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſet down there? therefore as union is the higheſt ground of the higheſt Communion, ſo all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that we have depends upon the Communion that he hath with the Father; and he being the neereſt, we have the greateſt ground of boldneſs and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, when <hi>we come unto God by him:</hi> thus he is every way a fit inſtrument for all the principal ends, whether they reſpect God or man.</p>
                  <pb n="646" facs="tcp:168372:90"/>
                  <p>Secondly, there are ſome additional ends to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed alſo, and Chriſt ſutes them all.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider the Lord eſtabliſhes the earth for the Elects ſake; that all the creatures that are for mans uſe be not deſtroyed, it is for the Elects ſake: for Juſtice did require as ſpeedy vengeance upon men, as it did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Angels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. now it is by the ſecond Covenant that God doth eſtabliſh the earth, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to pay the debt; for the ſentence had been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted immediately, had not this Covenant taken place; and therfore, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. it <hi>is by him that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,</hi> therefore his name is called <hi>Adonai,</hi> which doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a <hi>baſis,</hi> which doth ſupport and uphold the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it fall not to ruine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, will God have the ſervices of all the creatures brought about unto him again, that they ſhall do him more ſervice then ever they ſhould have done, and bring him in more glory one way or other? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>they are ſaid to deny the Lord that bought them:</hi> he hath bought all the world, ſome as ſons, to live with him and enjoy him for ever; and ſome as ſlaves, as wicked men and Devils, to do him ſervice: the perſons of the one, and the ſervices of the other, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. the world is a great houſe, in which are <hi>Veſſels, ſome of honour, and ſome of diſhonour,</hi> but all for the maſters uſe: and all the croſs actions and ſinful ends of men and Devils, he doth as a skilful Phyſitian temper as ſo many croſs ingredients that make one wholſom medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: or as a skilful Muſitian, out of the diſcord of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtrings, makes a ſweet and a pleaſant harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if he will have the world ruled; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rules of the firſt Covenant, he will rule
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:168372:90"/> men no more, but he muſt deſtroy them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God the Father cannot govern immediatly: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a change of the Covenant, there muſt needs be a change of the Government: Now who ſhall govern the world? there is none ſo fit to do it as Chriſt himſelf; and therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>the Government is upon his ſhoulders. Ioh.</hi> 5.23. and therefore the Saints of God do rejoyce in this, that <hi>the Lord raigns,</hi> and that not only in the Church, as ſome have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but <hi>in all the Kingdoms of the world, Pſalm</hi> 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>What is man that thou remembereſt him? thou haſt put all things in ſubjection to him: and for him are all things: and by him are all things:</hi> it is ſpoken of him as Mediator, God-man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> he is <hi>made head over all things to the Church;</hi> over the Church, and over all things in the world for the Churches ſake, and ſo he is the perſon that diſpenſeth both Covenants, and he is the great Executioner of all the decrees of God: for <hi>God hath committed all Judgement to the Son;</hi> yea, as he <hi>is the ſon of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, will God have the creatures reconciled one to another? there is none ſo fit to do it as Chriſt; ſin did make a breach in the whole creation: and when man ſinned, all the creatures became enemies to him, and one to another, that <hi>a man is affraid of the ſtones of the field;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 5.23.</note> but now in Chriſt there is an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. and in him Angels and men are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> and all the creatures, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. there is a Covenant that the Lord made with the beaſts, and the creeping things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that being one with Chriſt, all the creatures being his ſervants, they do all become your ſervants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. all things are yours, for ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="648" facs="tcp:168372:91"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, would God have the creatures not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored but inriched? Firſt, thoſe inferiour creatures that the ſin of man hath defaced, as we ſee in this earth, but the old ruines of glory, and the beauty of them all is gone, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>we look for new heavens, and a new earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. there ſhall come <hi>a time of the reſtauration of all things;</hi> and who ſhall do this? <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. he ſaith, <hi>Behold I make all things new:</hi> and it is admirable to conſider the reſtauration of things, and that golden age which the Lord hath promiſed in the latter daies of the world, when all perſecuting Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies ſhall be taken down <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in men, will the Lord not only reſtore, but redeem; <hi>melioratus eſt;</hi> he will give them a higher righteouſneſs, <hi>the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> even that righteouſneſs to which the God-head gave efficacie &amp; excellency; the members of Chriſt have a higher and a neerer union then the Angels had; for theirs was but a moral union, but the Saints have a myſtical union, &amp; a higher Son-ſhip then the Angels had; for theirs was but by <hi>creation,</hi> but ours by <hi>adoption,</hi> &amp; a more glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herirance in this that we <hi>enter into our Maſters Ioy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Angels that never fell have, Firſt, a glorious head in him, who hath undertaken both guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and influence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a high imployment, <hi>principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> which came in with the ſecond Covenant; when Chriſts adminiſtration upon earth ſhall ceaſe, then alſo <hi>he will put down all rule, and authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they receive the Spirit of God that acts them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.12. and they receive
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:168372:91"/> many gifts from this ſpirit, even a ſpirit of Propheſie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, will God have the world Judged? there is none fit but he that is the Son of man to Judge the world; <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>he will Judge the world by the man whom he hath appointed;</hi> and who is able to do this but Chriſt? to take the accounts of all the world, or tell them what they owe unto God, and what is due in puniſhments or rewards from God unto them again, <hi>he only can open the Books:</hi> the Book of Conſcience, and the Book of Gods decrees: <hi>and diſcover the hidden things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the counſels of the heart,</hi> &amp;c. and when he hath performed this laſt and great ſervice, and given up the Kingdom of the Church to God the Father, then <hi>God ſhall be all in all</hi> in the Son, as well as in the Saints: and it will appear that he is the higheſt end, and his glory the utmoſt aim of both: and that all the glory that Chriſt hath, he hath as the Fathers ſervant, and ſo it is with the Saints alſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus if we conſider all the ends of God, Chriſt hath in him a fitneſs that doth anſwer them all.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="1" type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>Take notice of the goodneſs of God in this: it was a great mercy to provide a Mediator, and an act meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of free-grace: and to do all this for you when you fell from him, when he did not catch after the Angels but let them go; but the Lord adds to his mercy much in the ſuitableneſs of it, that your Mediator ſhould be taken up amongſt your brethren, and <hi>he that ſanctifies, and they that are ſanctified to be of one;</hi> for it is the
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:168372:92"/> ſuitableneſs of the mercy that doth make it much the greater; for God to give <hi>Adam</hi> a help, when amongſt the creatures there was none found, was a mercy; but now for the Lord to give him a meet help, a friend of a ſuitable ſpirit; and a calling ſuitable to a mans diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (for all ſweetneſs doth ariſe from fitneſs) O what a great mercy is this, for God to give a man ſuch a relation, <hi>which is as his own ſoul!</hi> Now how ſhould this ſweeten the Lord Chriſt unto a man? and how ſhould we ſtudy his ſuitableneſs unto Gods ends? as he is Gods ſervant, we ſhould labour to bring our hearts into ſuch a holy frame that the Lord may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in our ſuitableneſs alſo, with all his ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; we ſhould take comfort in a ſuitable wife, eſtate, employment, but above all in a meet Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this doth plainly argue, that <hi>God will give us all things, Rom.</hi> 8.32. A wiſe builder doth make his building in ſome meaſure anſwerable to the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſurely he that hath laid a foundation of Saphires, he will not build upon it mud-walls, and cover them with a roof of ſtraw; he hath laid the foundation in Chriſt his only ſon: and <hi>if he did not ſpare him,</hi> ſurely <hi>he will with him give us all things,</hi> &amp;c. So he that hath fitted you with a Mediator anſwerable to all Gods ends and your ends, he will ſurely fit you with all things; ſo that thou ſhalt want nothing that thou ſtandſt in need of: he will give thee a ſutable eſtate, and <hi>feed thee with food conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for thee;</hi> he will diſpenſe mercies to thee in the fitteſt time, for <hi>the Lord waits to be gracious;</hi> he takes meaſure of mens ſpirits; you may think, It would be fit for me to have ſuch a mercy, but the Lord denyes it you; let me tell thee, mercies in thy time, without
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:168372:92"/> Gods time, will do thee hurt: if thou have a mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou be ripe for it, before God ſee a fitneſs in thee to receive it, it will be unſeaſonable; God takes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mens ſpirits I ſay, and defers mercies that his children long for, till they be made meet to receive them; therefore if God with-hold any good thing from thee, do you conclude, Surely it is not fit for me; for elſe he that hath fitted us with a Mediator, he would never fail to fit you with all things elſe.</p>

                  <p>If an inſtrumental fitneſs be an honour to Chriſt, then it muſt needs be ſo unto us, to be <hi>veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour fitted for the Maſters uſe:</hi> and here Conſider,</p>

                  <pb n="652" facs="tcp:168372:93"/>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a great honour to be uſeful amongſt the creatures; <hi>Eliakim</hi> was highly exalted by God, <hi>I will faſten him as a nayl in a ſure place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.23,24.

It is the honour of <hi>godlineſs</hi> to be <hi>profitable for all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord is exceedingly pleaſed with the ſervices of his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>I found Iſrael as grapes in the Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. but they are then more ſpecially acceptable, if their ſervices proceed from a ſpirit ſuited and prepared for them: for a good work from an unprepared heart, is a provocation unto God, and a ſign of hypocriſie in the man, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.14. and truly if our ſervices be not acceptable to God, they will never be comfortable unto us.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="question">
                  <head>Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>The great Queſtion therefore which we ſhould ſtudy all our daies, ſhould be, What will make a man fit for ſervice?</p>
                  <p>I will give you a few things briefly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he that will be fitted for ſervice, muſt be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame principle Chriſt was, and he muſt do all from a principle of union and unction; Chriſt did his from a perſonal union, and from an unction without meaſure, being cloathed with the Spirit; but we, from a myſtical union, and <hi>an unction from the ſame ſpirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our meaſure,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. having received this ſpirit as a ſpirit of regeneration and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for there are no ſervices of an unregenerate man,
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:168372:93"/> that can either pleaſe God or profit himſelf, becauſe of the corrupt principle from which they flow; for he prayes from the ſame principle that he ſins, and the ſpirit of Satan doth as truly work in him in the one, as it doth in the other; and therefore his religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances are turned into ſins, only his ſins proceed from a principle of open enmity, and his duties from a principle of ſecret flatterie. <hi>Semen naturae,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore ſaies <hi>Luther, Bona opera non faciunt bonum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſed vir bonus facit opera bona:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>A good tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good fruit: fructus non faciunt arbores bonas vel malas.</hi> The tree goes before the fruit, and the fruit is anſwerable to it; therefore if the tree be evil, and thou have not in thee an inward principle of union and unction, thou art not fitted for ſervice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt was fitted for ſervice by this, that as he did not his own will, ſo he ſought not his own glory, but did all his ſervices from a principle of ſelf-denyal. <hi>I ſeek not mine own glory, but the glory of him that ſent me;</hi> that was all the gain he ſought for, that his Father ſhould be glorified: <hi>Non tantum poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio, ſed proprietas acquiritur à Domino.</hi> There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold faithfulneſs, as there is a two-fold integrity: there is an uprightneſs particularly in ſome one act, as there was in <hi>Abimelech, In the integrity of my heart did I this, Gen.</hi> 20.6. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.2. <hi>and I took unto me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſſes,</hi> Uriah <hi>the Prieſt,</hi> who was not faithful to the things of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a man may be faithful in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions between man and man, and yet be very falſe and unfaithful in the univerſal courſe of his life between him and God, as this <hi>Uriah</hi> was, who made the new faſhioned Altar for <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Whileſt the Lord Chriſt was upon earth, he had not the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:168372:94"/> any thing in the earth; though he was Lord of al, he was maintained by the benevolence of his ſervants, denyed himſelf in his honour, and in his eaſe, had no will of his own, but the will of duty overcame the will of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: O why ſhould not we aſpire to be like our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but how few make this example theirs! <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Men are willing to tread out the corn,</hi> &amp;c. but it is hard to find men that in ſervice are carried with a ſingle eye; it is eaſie with <hi>Jehu</hi> to pretend Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo proffer to do much for God, under a cloak of covetouſneſs or preheminence, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rich and great; I fear that is the deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and its ſtrange to ſee what poor reſpects will ſway with men in this kind, in things of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as <hi>Saul, honour me before the people;</hi> and <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. the Table of the Lord is polluted by the Prieſts, they offered polluted bread, they would have been glad it had been better, but the people were newly come out of Captivity, and did ſnuff at the ſacrifices, and therefore they ſaid they muſt take what the people would bring, elſe they ſhould get nothing; the worſhip of God would ceaſe they thought, <hi>potius omnia rejiciunt;</hi> and ſo men do, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; Men that bend with the times, and maintain truth in an artificial middle way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt did all his ſervices from a principle of love and deſire to pleaſe God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi> he did all, <hi>that the world may know that I love the Father.</hi> Chriſt indeed loved the Church, but his great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that prevailed moſt with him, is love to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Amor eſt pondus animae:</hi> the byas of his ſoul: <hi>Amore deſiderii,</hi> to be united to him; <hi>Amore complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> delighting in him; and the love of benevolence too
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:168372:94"/> returns all to him again; for this principle lies at his heart as <hi>coals of Juniper, &amp;c.</hi> and all this was to pleaſe God; for Chriſt did not pleaſe himſelf in what he did; there is ſelf-pleaſing, and men-pleaſing, which acts many men in their ſervices; but there are few with Chriſt and <hi>Paul,</hi> that do all they do that they may pleaſe God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.29. <hi>I am not alone, but the Father is with me, for I do alwaies the things that pleaſe him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt was zealous for God in all things, and the things of God were dear to him: with how much earneſtneſs doth he aſſert the truth againſt the Hereticks, the Phariſees, Sadduces, and Herodians in his time? he <hi>whipt buyers and ſellers out of the Temple:</hi> nay if his Diſciple be an Inſtrument of Satan, he ſaith, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. <hi>if they bring not this word, receive them not:</hi> give them no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhew no friendſhip to them, nor familiarity with them, leaſt you thereby encourage them in an evil way, as <hi>Polycarpus</hi> ſaies to <hi>Marcion</hi> the Heretick, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te eſſe primogenitum Satanae.</hi> Men are but as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, have a great ſhew of zeal for God, but when they come to act any thing, they are key-cold, <hi>&amp;c. Tranſlucent ad modum ardentis prunae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he acted with reſolution, and was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged for want of ſucceſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4. <hi>I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet ſurely my Iudgement is with thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There is a curſe pronounced upon him that <hi>doth the work of the Lord negligently,</hi> or deceitfully, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>though Iſrael were not gathered, my reward is with the Lord. Duty is ours, ſucceſs is Gods,</hi> ſhould be a Chriſtians Motto; when we undertake any ſervice
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:168372:95"/> for God, we ſhould caſt our burden upon him alone, all the burden of ſucceſs: for many men do promiſe themſelves much ſucceſs, and undertake a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for God, and think to go through the difficulties they meet withal, yet afterward they ſay as he did, Old <hi>Adam</hi> is too ſtrong for young <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Chriſt did ſerve God ſo in his publike Miniſtery, that he neglected not his private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; he Preached publikely all the day, when it might have been ſaid, <hi>Maſter ſpare thy ſelf;</hi> yet he <hi>got into a Mountain at night alone to pray:</hi> he roſe up a great while before it was day, to ſpend ſome time in ſecret fellowſhip with God: and is not this our duty to maintain our private Communion? It is an evil way we are all ſubject to, to neglect private benefits to our ſouls, under the pretence of publike ſervice and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: and let me tell you, ſins of omiſſion at the laſt day will be their deſtruction, when many ſhall guaſh their teeth and ſay, I have been employed in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Kingdoms: I bore up the Pillars of the earth, but now I am ſhut out: I have been employed in that great work in ſaving ſouls, but now I my ſelf am a caſt-away: I ſhone as a ſtar upon earth, but now I muſt for ever be in the horror of darkneſs. Oh who would not tremble at theſe ſad apprehenſions, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a ſuitable frame of ſpirit with the Lord Chriſt, in all our ſervices! that the Lord may ſay unto us, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter thou into the Ioy of thy Lord.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſcope of this Chapter ſets forth the Providence of God in the Government of the world; for all things paſs under a Providence: he that made all things to their ends, doth rule and act all things unto the ſame ends. This is ſet forth by a threefold Viſion in this Chapter: and thoſe three Viſions preſent
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:168372:96"/> unto you a four-fold ſubordination of cauſes in the Providential Kingdom of God; for I muſt a little give you light into the whole Chapter.</p>
               <p>Firſt you find in the 26. <hi>verſe</hi> (for that is firſt in nature, though it be laſt in place) there is <hi>a Firmament, and upon it the likeneſs of a Throne; and one ſits upon the Throne in appearance like the Son of man;</hi> this is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the glory of God in the perſon of the Mediator, into whoſe hands the Providential Kingdom of God is committed, together with the change of the Government: There was a neceſſity of the change of the Government; therefore <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.22. <hi>the Father Iudgeth no man, but he hath committed all Iudgement unto the Son:</hi> for which cauſe God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calls Chriſt the Mediator <hi>my King;</hi> he rules for him: he is my King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. There is a twofold Kingdom of God committed to the Mediator, <hi>the man Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> the ſpiritual Kingdom by which he rules in the hearts of his people: ſo <hi>he is King of Saints.</hi> The providential Kingdom likewiſe by which he rules in the affairs of the world, and ſo <hi>he is the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Chriſt now is deſcribed here, as being King in the Providential Kingdom; that is the firſt in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of cauſes, in the Government of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt, though the Government be committed unto him, yet he doth not rule immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he rules all things by the ſpirit, and that in the Providential, as well as in the Spiritual Kingdom: that is ſet forth to you in the 12. and the 20. <hi>verſes</hi> of this Chapter; <hi>Whether the Spirit was to go, they went; and whereſoever the Spirit was to go, thither was their Spirit alſo for to go.</hi> Here is a Spirit that acteth the Angels as
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:168372:96"/> well as the Saints, and all inferiour Agents. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is <hi>the Vice-Roy of Chriſt;</hi> Mark what I ſay: as Chriſt is Gods <hi>Pro-Rex,</hi> and rules for him; ſo the Spirit I ſay of the Mediator is the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of Chriſt, and rules for Chriſt in the adminiſtration of all things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerve, though it is true the Spirit of Chriſt is not to the Angels a principle of Sanctification; for they ſtand in the ſame righteouſneſs in which they were created: yet the Spirit is unto the Angels a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of direction, and that in all their waies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. the Angels receive a Spirit of Propheſie from Chriſt. <hi>I am of your Brethren the Prophets,</hi> ſaith the Angel there: an Angel, a Prophet? yes, and he that hath the teſtimonie of Jeſus; what is the teſtimonie of Jeſus? <hi>the teſtimonie of Ieſus is the Spirit of Prophecy:</hi> Why then the Angels have a ſpirit of Prophecy from Chriſt: the Spirit of Chriſt the Mediator is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their Doctrine, though not of their Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. That is the ſecond thing in the Order of cauſes in the Government of all things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Spiritacteth the living creatures: that is the third Viſion; that is the third ſubordination: you read in the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>of a Viſion of living creatures, with four faces,</hi> &amp;c. What were theſe living creatures? why look into the 10. Chap. and the 20. verſe, you have it there expounded by the Spirit, <hi>I perceived</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>that they were the Cherubims;</hi> the living creatures that are there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of were the Cherubims; they are the Angels that be called the living creatures: for this cauſe the Angels now being imployed by Chriſt in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, they be called in Scripture <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers.</hi> There is a double Government
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:168372:97"/> come into the world with the Kingdom of Chriſt, that ſhould never have been elſ; the government of Angels, the Government of Magiſtrates; it is true, both are eminent Ordinances of God, but yet both introduced and occaſioned by ſin: a natural ſubjection of man to man there ſhould have been, if man had not falen; but a civil ſubjection of man to man there ſhould not have been: <hi>Nomen iſtud culpa meruit &amp; non natura,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auſtin:</note> ſaith <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and for that cauſe, <hi>when Chriſt ſhall give up the Kingdom to the Father,</hi> he will put down both theſe: the authority of Magiſtrates, and the authority of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: <hi>he will put down all rule, and all authority, and power:</hi> theſe authorities began with the Kingdom of Chriſt: and before Chriſt ſhall give up the Kingdom to the Father, he will put them all down. <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> So Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds the place, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. Conſider then the ſpirit of Chriſt: Chriſt ſends forth his ſpirit: the ſpirit acteth the Angels: that is the third in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of cauſes: Only my beloved, there are two ſtrange benefits that the people of God have by the Government of Angels. Firſt, the Angels rule for them. Secondly, the Angels pray for them: the Angels rule for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>they are miniſtring ſpirits for the good of the Elect; he gives his Angels charge over thee:</hi> Then the Angels pray for them: ſee an Angel praying to Chriſt, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.12. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Chriſt prayeth to the Father: here an Angel prayeth for the Church, and attaineth an anſwer of prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.16,17. <hi>the thing is by the decree of the Watchers, and the demand by the command of the Holy ones:</hi> it is ſpoken of the Judgement brought upon that great tyrant and oppreſſor <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> the demand, you ſhall read that in the petition: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:168372:97"/> it is the requeſt of the Watchers: ſo the Angels are called; and I remember it is an obſervation <hi>Origen</hi> hath, when we pray (ſaith he) there are millions of heavenly Angels, Celeſtial Spirits do joyn with us, they do pray with us, unſpoken to, unasked. Then I intreate you conſider, that is the third ſubordination in the Government of all things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the fourth in this ſubordination, in the Government of the world, is, the Spirit rules the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the living creatures. But then here is another Viſion, <hi>a Viſion of Wheels:</hi> I, ſo all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are called; it is reſembled to the <hi>Moon,</hi> becauſe it is in a continual change, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. that is to ſay, <hi>they have the Moon under their feet:</hi> reſembled to the <hi>Sea, Dan.</hi> 7.2. becauſe the Sea is in <hi>perpetuo fluxu,</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ebbing, and flowing, never at a ſtay: there is an unquiet principle in it ſelf: So here ſuitable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it is reſembled unto Wheels: why? they are in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuo motu,</hi> alwaies moving, they are never at a ſtay; their very form of which they are made, fitteth them for nothing elſe: all things here belovv are compared to wheels. Now I intreate you conſider, who it is that acteth theſe wheels: Chriſt ſendeth the Spirit, the Spirit acteth the living creatures: Now the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the wheels, and the Text ſaith, <hi>the Spirit of the living creatures is in the Wheels:</hi> In the 20. <hi>verſe</hi> ſo it is ſaid, <hi>When the living creatures moved, then the Wheels moved; when the living creatures ſtood, then the Wheels ſtood:</hi> Why? becauſe the Spirit of the living creatures is in the wheels; the Spirit of Chriſt acteth the Angels, the Angels have a great influence in the acting of things below. Now concerning theſe wheels, here are ſeven things ſpoken: and truly they
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:168372:98"/> are all of them weighty truths; truths of very exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great conſequence, and of very great uſe for the preſent times; and therefore I ſhall in a word offer them to your conſideration. This, that is in the text is the laſt of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the 18. <hi>verſe</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>the Rings of theſe wheels are full of eyes within;</hi> things in the world are not carried by the wills of men, <hi>coeco impetu,</hi> by a kind of blind force, as if men ruled the world: No, my Brethren, in all the turnings that there are in the world, know, the wheels be full of eyes; all things are carried and ordered by a wiſe and a fore-ſeeing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the wheels go upon their four ſides,</hi> in the 17. <hi>verſe,</hi> that is, they are conſtant, and ſettled in their motion: men may turn from one ſide to another, as it is common for them to do; they may change their principles, and act quite contrary: they may deſtroy that which formerly they have endeavoured to build; but yet notwithſtanding the wheels go upon their four ſides ſtill; there is no turning of Providence out of that way: you may uſe your art, you may uſe your power, uſe your policy, the Wheels will ſtill go on upon their four ſides: Gods providence is ſtable, and ſettled in its motion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the wheels return not when they go:</hi> that is another; God hath not in waies of Providence retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade motions: when the Lord begins, he doth uſe to make an end: <hi>in decretis ſapientum nulla eſt litura:</hi> wiſe men make no blots: if God go forth againſt a people, if God go forth againſt a perſon, truly, the Lord car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on his work: as the wheels are conſtant in their motion, ſo likewiſe they are ſo ſettled, that they are
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:168372:98"/> carried on, there is no returning; <hi>they returned not as they went.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Rings are ſaid to be <hi>high, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreadful,</hi> in the 18. <hi>verſe.</hi> The actings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are very terrible: I ſay the actings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are very terrible: when men look upon them with an eye of reaſon, truly they cannot but ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; when you ſhall ſee God cutting ſhort the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Princes, plucking up Kingdoms, deſtroying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, depoſing Kings: when you ſhall ſee the Lord cauſing <hi>the Mountains to skip, and the Towers to fall;</hi> the Rings be exceeding high, and therefore exceeding dreadful: ſuch high actings of Providence when they are ſeriouſly conſidered, cannot but ſtrike terror in the minds of men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>the wheels are ſometimes lifted up from the earth:</hi> Mark ye, ſo the text ſaith: ſometimes they go upon the earth: Providence acteth in an ordinary way; ſometimes the Wheels are lifted up from the earth, they go out of the ordinary rode; God acteth in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary waies of Providence. Now I intreate you conſider, the Lord doth not go alwaies by ruled caſes: many times rules are preſcribed, but none muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to him; many times the Wheels are lifted up from the earth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the Wheels ſometimes ſtand, they do not alwaies go; for ſo you ſee, <hi>when the living creatures ſtood, the Wheels ſtood over againſt them:</hi> they ſometimes ſtand I ſay, they do not alwaies go: there is many times a ſeeming ceſſation of Providence; Pray obſerve it; there is many times I ſay, a ſeeming ceſſation of Providence; the Angels ſeem to let down their wings, and the Wheels ſeem to be at a ſtand: many times
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:168372:99"/> things are becalmed, that you would think ſurely now the buſineſs is like never to go on, all things are at a ſtand: by and by the ſpirit of God acteth the living creatures: the living creatures again, they act the Wheels: You know how it was in the building of the Temple, ſometimes the work was at a ſtand for divers years together; by and by the Spirit of God ſtirred up the heart of ſome one or other again, and then the work was revived, then the Wheels went again. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I humbly pray you; ſometimes there ſeems to be a ceſſation of Providence, but yet the Lord will carry on his work.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place: and ſo I come to the text. Thereis <hi>a Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>el in the midle of a Wheel:</hi> there is a double interpretation given of it; you may do very well to take in both, though it is the laſt that I ſhall ſtick to. <hi>A Wheel in the midſt of a VVheel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it notes <hi>motionem tranſverſam:</hi> I ſay there is in it <hi>motio tranſverſa;</hi> that is, it implyes a motion that is croſs and thwarting, like the motions of Watches, or ſome curious work, where one Wheel moves one way, and yet it acteth another Wheel that moves quite the contrary way; this is Gods ordinary way in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; he accompliſheth things by tranſverſe, and croſs and contrary motions. So you may obſerve a <hi>Saul</hi> labouring for to eſtabliſh the Kingdom upon his Poſteritie, was the great means to ſettle the Crown upon <hi>Davids</hi> head: God doth many times carry on things by a tranſverſe (I ſay) and a contrary motion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is likewiſe not only a tranſverſe motion, but there is alſo <hi>motio complexa,</hi> a complex motion: and ſo the word ſignifies, <hi>a Wheel in the midſt
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:168372:99"/> of a Wheel:</hi> a motion that is intricate, intangled one in another, like to ſome curious water-works, that you ſhall ſee the Wheels do not only turn croſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another, and one wheel moving this way, ſhall act another wheel moving that way; but withal, it is a hard matter for a man that is not skilful in the Art, to be able to diſcern which way it is the Wheels are turned ſo one within another. A man that is not skilful in a Globe, would wonder to know what the meaning of thoſe many lines and circles ſhould be; they all go one within another: ſo, here is a wheel in the midſt of a wheel; Providence is ſo intricate, ſo complex, ſo myſterious, it is impoſſible for a man that is not an Artiſt in Providence, to be able to ſee the waies, and the goings forth of God in them. That now is the ſenſe of this Scripture, as I conceive: and the Obſervation that I ſhall give you from it, is this;</p>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The actings of Providence are very intricate, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious:</hi> I ſay, the actings of Providence are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate and myſterious; that it will poſe men of the greateſt parts, and of the greateſt graces to be able to diſcern the waies of God in them. My Brethren, there is <hi>the wiſdom of God in a myſterie,</hi> in his Works as well as in his Word. This I ſhall briefly clear to you by a few inſtances out of Scripture; then I ſhall ſhew you ſome of thoſe intricate and myſterious actings of Providence for the manifeſtation of the truth of the Doctrine, and then ſhall come to the Application thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="666" facs="tcp:168372:100"/>
                  <p>Firſt then for the proof of it, take theſe three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.2. <hi>Clouds and darkneſs are round about him; righteouſneſs and judgement are the habitation of his Throne:</hi> how doth the Lord when he doth miniſter judgement and righteouſneſs in the world, how doth he carry himſelf? truly he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold himſelf in a dark cloud; clouds and darkneſs are round about him, ſaith he: as it is ſaid of the Virgin when ſhe conceived, <hi>the ſpirit of God over-ſhaddowed her:</hi> ſo my Brethren, the Lord is pleaſed to act things in Providence in an over-ſhaddowing way: that is the firſt inſtance for the proof of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, look into <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. <hi>Thy Iudgements are as a great deep, thou ſaveſt both man and beaſt:</hi> it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the actings of God in the demonſtrations of Providence: and he ſaith, there is no tracing of God, no more then you could trace a mans foot-ſteps in the bottom of the Sea: thy Judgements are as a great deep. The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. uſeth an expreſſion ſuitable, <hi>how unſearchable are his waies!</hi> waies that are without foot-ſteps, you cannot trace them, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, here God hath gone, he hath walked ſo my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriouſly: <hi>how unſearchable are his waies, and his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom paſt finding out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, look into <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.19. <hi>Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy foot ſteps are not known.</hi> Why, the actings of God in the world, they are beyond the reach of the wiſeſt men, the greateſt Polititians, that the truth is, when they look upon the waies of Providence, they cannot yet tell whether God will go forward, or backward: for his way is in the Sea, and his path in the great waters,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:168372:100"/> his foot ſteps are not known: actings of Providence are very intricate, and myſterious: a wheel in the midſt of a wheel. I will give you ſome inſtances of it, that by this means, the meaning of the Doctrine may be the more clearly ſeen. There are ſix inſtances as projects of providence, that I ſhall ſet before you, wherein you muſt acknowledge that the Lord works very myſteriouſly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, God carries on all things by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and an inviſible vertue, that though you ſee the hand without, yet you ſee not the ſpring within. It is ſaid of the Angels, <hi>the living creatures, that they had wings, but they had the hands of a man under their wings:</hi> the hand; what is the hand? it is <hi>ſymholum roboris,</hi> it is <hi>inſtrumentum operationis,</hi> it is an expreffion of ſtrength, it is the great inſtrument of action; Now there were hands put forth, they worked effectually; I, but ſecretly; the hands be under their wings: ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve I beſeech you, there is a Spirit of the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the wheels: the text ſaith, all things are acted by a ſecret, a hidden, and an inviſible vertue: that though there do nothing appear, yet ſtill the thing is carried on, no body can tell how; For inſtance; The Lord would build the Temple: there was the higheſt oppoſition that could be: a <hi>Samaritan</hi> faction at home, and that backed with the power of the whole <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire: yet notwithſtanding there is an inviſible ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue carries on the work: that all this power cannot hinder, but <hi>this mountain muſt become a plain before</hi> Zerubabel, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7. Well, that is firſt, it muſt needs be myſterious I ſay, becauſe, though you ſee the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:168372:101"/> without, yet there is an inviſible vertue within, that you do not ſee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, mens ſpirits are many times raiſed unto an extraordinary pitch beyond the ſpirits of men: drawn out to higher reſolutions, they pitch upon higher thoughts and purpoſes then ever the times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: why now mark, here is a myſterie in this, that at one time a man ſhould riſe higher then at another time, and their reſolutions, and courages riſe higher, and they ſhould dare to encounter with thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that even formerly they did tremble to think of: What is the reaſon of it? Oh here is the myſterie of Providence; in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. <hi>the weak ſhall be as</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> David <hi>as an Angel of God:</hi> What is that? why, the Lord makes it as a ſpecial promiſe; he ſaith, how he would raiſe the ſpirits of men, that he that formerly was weak, weak in body, weak in heart, he ſhould now be as <hi>David,</hi> as valiant, and as ſtout a Souldier, as skilful and expert in war, as ready to encounter with the greateſt difficulties, and look the ſtouteſt Gyant in the face; the weak ſhall be as <hi>David;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> a man that had but ſuch a degree of ſpirit as <hi>David</hi> had, now truly he ſhould have the ſpirit of an Angel: Mark ye, God raiſeth the ſpirits of men; a mighty myſterie of Providence lies in it: <hi>When the worm Jacob ſhall threſh Mountains:</hi> I, when it is a worm, and a worm ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to encounter Mountains: <hi>When a Barly Cake ſhall over-throw a Tent; when Cities ſhall be like to figgs that fall into the mouthes of the eater: and Captains and valiant men ſhall be like thoſe Graſs-hoppers in a Sunny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> here is a great myſterie of Providence, that they that are <hi>men of might</hi> at one time, <hi>ſhall not find their
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:168372:101"/> hands</hi> at another: What is the reaſon? My Brethren, the works of Providence are very intricate and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>In the third place; God puts impreſſions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions upon men many times, that they run to their own ruines: I ſay, there be apprehenſions raiſed, and left upon the ſpirits of men, that they run to their own ruine, <hi>as the horſe ruſheth into the Battle:</hi> ſometimes impreſſions of diſcouragement: Mark, <hi>Judges</hi> 7. there was a man dreamed that a Barly Cake over-threw a Tent; God ſets on an impreſſion of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: this is nothing (ſay they) <hi>but the ſword of the Lord, and the ſword of</hi> Gideon.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes impreſſions of encouragements, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.22,23. this is a ſtrange ſtory. There comes out a mighty Army of the <hi>Moabites</hi> to encounter with the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> in the morning as the Sun began to riſe, they ſaw the Sun ſhine upon the water, and it looked red like blood: preſently, what was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion? ſay they preſently, <hi>the Kings have deſtroyed one another; ariſe</hi> Moab <hi>to the ſpoyl:</hi> Mark, God ſet on ſuch an impreſsion, ſuch an apprehenſion upon their ſpirits, that they by this means run on to their own ruine, as you ſhall ſee in the enſuinng ſtory. And ſo likewiſe when the Red sea was divided before the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſuch a deſperate ſpirit ſeized upon <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that in their purſuite he ſhould follow them into the Red Sea. Conſider, here lies the myſterie of Providence, God ſets on ſuch an apprehenſion upon the ſpirits of men, that they ſhall run on to their own ruine.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place: God many times raiſeth up In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and he qualifies them for his work: girding
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:168372:102"/> up their loyns, and ſtrengthening their hands, that they ſhall go through that at one time, that you would have thought ten thouſand inſtruments could not have done it at another. This now is Gods ſeaſon. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Lord raiſed him up; <hi>I will hold his hands</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will gird his loyns, Iſa.</hi> 45.1,2. and then God laies the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument aſide again at another time: Mark, many times the Lord will make a combination, and there ſhall be a conjunction of Inſtruments, and afterwards the Lord will make uſe of theſe, even to deſtroy one another: here are the myſteries of Providence. <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milech</hi> and the men of <hi>Shechem</hi> joyn, they make him King; who would have thought but that certainly the men of <hi>Schechem</hi> would have ſtuck to <hi>Abimelech</hi> for ever, having now renounced the houſe of <hi>Jerubaal?</hi> but mark, when they had done the work that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, their conjunction falls: why then, then <hi>fire comes out of</hi> Abimelech <hi>&amp; devoures the men of</hi> Shechem, <hi>and fire comes out of the men of</hi> Shechem <hi>and deſtroyes</hi> Abimelech: Here now are the ſtrange myſteries of Providence.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place: God many times deſtroyes men by thoſe means by which in all humane judgement they think they ſhall be preſerved: I ſay, God doth uſually deſtroy men by thoſe means by which in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane judgement they think they ſhall be preſerved. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were in any neceſſity, then by and by unto <hi>King Jareb,</hi> which ſome expound to be a helping King: <hi>ſometimes in the way of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>ſometimes in the way of</hi> Egypt; yet notwithſtanding, they were deſtroyed by thoſe that they brought in to their help. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was low, why truly they would needs have a King: the King ruined their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:168372:102"/> almoſt: <hi>the earth is weak</hi> (I ſhould read it) <hi>the Land is weak, and the inhabitants thereof, I ſhould bear up the Pillars thereof: Saul</hi> was weak, and deſtroyed the Land. When <hi>David</hi> came to the Crown, he did bear up the Pillars thereof: I beſeech you conſider it, it is an ordinary thing therefore, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.25. <hi>the Lord turneth wiſe men backward;</hi> the meaning of it is; take all their counſels, and the events no way anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but the quite contrary. the quite contrary unto what they did deſign is brought to paſs; wiſe men are turned back. Now theſe are the ſtrange actings of Providence. They bound <hi>Paul</hi> that he ſhould not preach: <hi>My bonds tend to the furtherance of the Goſpel.</hi> They baniſhed the Church out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſo they might have deſtroyed it: but that is the Churches preſervation, when <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe are the ſtrange actings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place: when things are brought to the loweſt ebb, the means weakeſt, and the confidence of the enemy and their expectation higheſt, then many times God is pleaſed to deſtroy the power of the mighty. When <hi>Gideon</hi> hath but three hundred men, he is fit to fight Gods Battles; yea, <hi>Siſera</hi> muſt fall by the hand of a woman. This is mighty conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.10. <hi>When they are drunk as the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, and folden together as thorns:</hi> that is, when they are unanimous as one man, their combination ſtrong, they are folded together as thorns, you cannot pull them aſunder, and by this means they are drunk with confidence as a drunkard; for ſuch a drunkenneſs is there ſpoken of: What then? <hi>they ſhall then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed like ſtubble that is drie:</hi> they are never ſo neer
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:168372:103"/> deſtruction; theſe are the myſterious actings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; why certainly then the Government of the world is like <hi>a Wheel in a Wheel;</hi> the actings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are very intricate and myſterious. I am ſorry the time hath ſo out-gone me: indeed it was the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication I aimed at. Let this ſerve for the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part: let us now come to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="application">
                  <p>If this be ſo, I have two Uſes to make of it; but it is the laſt I ſhall inſiſt upon.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is; In all actings of Providence ſubſcribe to his wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is: In all actings of Providence ſubmit to his will. Well, theſe are the two Uſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, If there be ſuch great myſteries in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, then ſubſcribe to his wiſdom; acknowledge that God only is able to govern the world: he is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in counſel, and mighty in working. <note place="margin">Luther.</note> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was a handſom reproof that <hi>Luther</hi> did once give to <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> when the Proteſtant cauſe lay very much at the ſtake: <hi>Melancthon</hi> was mightily troubled how things would go: <hi>Luther</hi> ſent him this meſſage, <hi>Monendus eſt Philippus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ut deſinat eſſe mundi gubernator:</hi> you muſt admoniſh <hi>Melancthon</hi> that he leave off to govern the world: alas government of the world belongs to God: Subſcribe to his wiſdom; ſay only, that he is fit to rule the world. That I did think a little to have enlarged my ſelf upon, but I dare not, becauſe I ſhall tranſgreſs. But the ſecond I would willingly, though I begg a little time of you to ſpeak ſomething of it</p>
                  <p>As you ſhould ſubſcribe to his wiſdom, becauſe his
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:168372:103"/> providence is myſterious. So likewiſe ſubmit to his will, I ſay ſubmit to his will. Oh, it is a ſad thing, that thoſe that profeſs obedience unto Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding will, ſhould yet harbour in their ſouls ſo much diſcontent at Gods effecting will then notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Truly, this is an evil that may befal a gracious heart. I will give you the example of a Saint: <hi>Ionah,</hi> in <hi>Ionah</hi> 4. God had cauſed a Gourd to ſpring up as a ſhade to <hi>Ionah</hi> in the night, and the Lord ſmote the Gourd at the root and it withered: the text ſaith, <hi>Ionahs heart rejoyced becauſe of the Gourd,</hi> his heart was ſhortned to the preſent contentment, and upon that cauſe God takes away the Gourd: <hi>Ionah</hi> is angry with this act of God. Now, I intreate you, if it be but a ſmal content, a conceit, a petty advantage, why yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if God act contrary to my deſign, that party goes not up that I would have, it may be, or I have not thoſe waies of advantage, or friends one way, that I could make another, for that cauſe truly that man is angry; this is (conſider I beſeech you) this is the true cauſe of all the grudgings in the world, and of all thoſe repinings and diſcontentments that there are in the world, becauſe men do not ſubmit their wills un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the effecting will of God. Now, I beſeech you be pleaſed to obſerve two or three things.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve in the firſt place; you ſin in this in a high degree in three things; you ſin in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you exalt your wiſdom above Gods, and it is as much as if you ſhould ſay: truly, things go not ſo well now as I could wiſh them; if the government of the world were in my power, truly matters ſhould be better ordered; you do plainly ſay ſo; that party
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:168372:104"/> ſhould prevail, that I would have prevail, and thoſe waies ſhould be carried on that I would have; for, (my Brethren) he that correcteth another mans act, doth in that (at leaſt) ſuppoſe he is wiſer then he.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hereby you exalt your wills above Gods, your will is the rule of goodneſs, not Gods. Now I intreate you obſerve, was the Devil ever guilty of higher Atheiſm then this? for a man to ſay, it is true, thus, and thus it is, and I muſt needs acknowledge it, that God judgeth the world: but yet I ſhould rather have judged it to have been better if it had been thus: what is this to ſay? truly, this is my will that is the rule of goodneſs, and not Gods: for if it had been as I would have it, it had been better. You little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when men are carried out in paſſion in ſuch things as theſe are, you little conſider the abomination of them. Nay,</p>
                  <p>In the third place, You hereby put God out of his Throne, for the government of the world; ſuch a man ſaith with <hi>Abſolom, Here is no man to do you Iuſtice;</hi> if the Government of the world were in my hand, things ſhould not be carried on with ſuch confuſion and diſorder; the Church of God ſhould not be brought to that diſtreſs, nor the world put into ſuch diſorder as now it is: Conſider what a high ſin is this: well, that is the firſt. But,</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place; I intreate you conſider this: do you think now when the Providence of God is ſo myſterious, and thy will riſeth againſt the actings of Providence, do you think you will turn God out of his way? do you think I ſay, that you ſhall turn God out of his way? No I beſeech you, obſerve it in
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:168372:104"/> 
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.2. <hi>the Lord will not call back his Word,</hi> ſaith the Text; it is not all your grudging (my Brethren) will make God go back; No, I entreate you, obſerve there in the 3. <hi>ver. I will riſe up againſt the help of thoſe that work iniquity; I, both they that work iniquity, and they that help them ſhall fail together,</hi> ſaith the Text: they and their helpers: it is true, many think by calling in help, by joyning partie to partie, counſel to counſel, they ſhall certainly prevail, and ſo by this means ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parties upon different intereſts and ends made up into one; Why, but what is the meaning of this? truly, they that could not prevail by themſelves, muſt never look to prevail by their helpers: ſaith God, I will riſe up againſt them that help them: do not think you ſhall turn God out of his way, becauſe it pleaſeth not you, the way that God goes in: No, thou mayſt ſet thy ſelf in a way againſt God, and fall before him. I will give you two inſtances of this: and truly they are very remarkable ones. One is that of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah: Ioram</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is wounded: <hi>Ahaziah.</hi> his brother in Law goes down to viſit him: you will ſay, this was but a brotherly curteſie: was there any harm in this? nothing but civilitie. I, but <hi>Ahaziah</hi> goes down at the ſame time when God was going forth in Judgement againſt <hi>Ioram,</hi> and againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and what follows? truly, <hi>Ahaziah</hi> dieth in the way: the ſame inſtrument that deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Ioram,</hi> deſtroyeth <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> that he periſheth in civilitie. I will give you another inſtance of a godly man; ſo that you may ſee it is dangerous to have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged will againſt the actings of Providence. <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> he wrought the great reformation that was in <hi>Iudah</hi> after the revolt of the ten Tribes, yet after he had
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:168372:105"/> wrought this reformation, yet this man he muſt be ſtanding in the way of Gods Providence. <hi>Pharo-Neco</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was appointed by God to execute a Judgement of God upon <hi>Charchemiſh</hi> a Citie that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> upon the borders of <hi>Euphrates;</hi> he deſires <hi>Ioſiah</hi> that he might have liberty (that being the ſhorter cut) to paſs through his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; <hi>Ioſiah</hi> he refuſeth it, and a man would have thought he had good reaſon for it too; he had had a great deal of experience heretofore of the crueltie of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they had been ill neighbors; and he was likewiſe in league and covenant with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he did owe fealtie, and allegiance, he had taken the oath of allegiance to him: and what ſhould he not be faithful to his King? upon this ground now he goes forth. (So <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>) — (So Doctor <hi>Uſher</hi> in his late <hi>Chronologie</hi>) a kind of ſuddain fierceneſs there roſe in the man, and what followeth? why, truly he dyeth in the way. <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> good reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tender hearted <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> yet he meets God in the way of his Judgements, and he dyeth in the way: therefore I ſay, take heed, think not your oppoſition will turn God out of the way: O, ſubmit your wills, his Providence is myſterious. But that I may a little give you ſome grounds for it, for the quieting of your hearts: take notice but of that expoſtulation firſt by the way: take notice of that expoſtulation of God unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for</hi> Saul, <hi>ſeeing I have rejected him? Saul</hi> was not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed from the Kingdom, <hi>Saul</hi> raigned ſtill: I, but Gods will was manifeſted to <hi>Samuel; Samuel</hi> mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, God reproveth his mourning: as if he ſhould have told him: Why doſt thou dote upon a man, as
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:168372:105"/> if the good of the whole Common-wealth lay upon him? rather look out for better for the time to come. God doth not love thoſe paſſions, neither will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in his own people, that croſs his will when it is manifeſted; how long wilt thou mourn for <hi>Saul,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have rejected him? Now to bring about your wills to the effecting will of God, I beſeech you be pleaſed but to conſider theſe two or three things; they are mighty quieting conſiderations, and ſo I have done.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place; conſider this: all the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world is committed unto Chriſt, I have told you: I ſay the Government of the world is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto Chriſt: <hi>the Father judgeth no man, he hath committed all Iudgement to the Son;</hi> it is the ſpeech of Chriſt that acteth the living creatures, and the living creatures act the wheels as you have heard. Now (my Brethren) ſhould not you be willing to leave all in Chriſts hand, ſeeing God hath committed all into his hands? There is a double title Chriſt hath, he is bound to be faithful in both.</p>
                  <p>1. As it is an office, in which he is imployed by God the Father: And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the Church is his own inheritance; Now I intreate you conſider, if all be committed to Chriſt, the government of all things; then I ſay, leave it with ſubmiſſion of will unto that hand into which God the Father hath placed it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I entreate you conſider this (which is a mighty quieting conſideration) Chriſt governs the Providential Kingdom, all for the good of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom. I ſay, Chriſt ſubordaineth the Kingdom of Providence unto the Kingdom of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22.
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:168372:106"/> 
                     <hi>he is made the head above all things unto the Church,</hi> he undertakes the government of all things for the Churches ſake, and he orders all things for their good, he is the head over all things unto the Church. It may be alas poor creature, when thou lookeſt upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence God walketh in the dark to thee: and how Chriſt will bring good out of all theſe, thou canſt not tell; leave it to him now: he is called <hi>the Artiſt, the skilful Artiſt.</hi> You have the place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. <hi>I was by him as one brought up with him;</hi> you read it ſo. I do a little wonder at the tranſlation: I was by him as one brought up with him: it is in the Original, <hi>I was by him as an Artificer:</hi> you have the ſame word ſo tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.1. <hi>by the hand of the cunning work-man;</hi> the very ſame word is uſed: now it may be, if a man unskilled ſhould come and look upon a man that were a curious Artiſt, it may be a Chymiſt, or the like, he would wonder how he ſhould be able to bring ſuch great effects out of ſuch unlikely things: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the man is contented to look on with delight, and reſteth upon the man for his art; for he ſaith, he knows how to bring it to paſs, though I do not. Jeſus Chriſt is a curious Artiſt; when you ſee him, take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in it, and reſt: for the art is in him, he knows how to bring it about, though you do not. That is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very quieting Conſideration. But.</p>
                  <p>In the third place; the Lord hath diſcovered to us the ends for which he worketh, and I am ſure his ends ſhall be effected: Now, if God will carry on his own ends, truly, what if ſome of my inferiour miſtaken ends miſs, ſhould I be diſcontented? no, let God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his own ends; he will carry them on.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay: What are his ends? His ends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:168372:106"/> the world at preſent are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>he will ſhake the things that are made,</hi> Heb. 12.27. <hi>that the things that cannot be ſhaken may remain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he will make way for the ruine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and Poperie in all the forms of it. I ſay, that is another end, and that he may deſtroy Antichriſt, and ruine Poperie in all the forms of it. And,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he may make waie for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that glorious promiſe; <hi>the Kingdoms of the earth ſhall become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Chriſt.</hi> Now I entreate you obſerve; If theſe ends of God be carried on, as they ſhall certainly be: then, what need have you to be diſquieted, becauſe ſome of your inferiour injudicious miſtaken ends be not brought about? truly this is that that comforteth a Godly man: and I confeſs it hath been in all theſe troubles and confuſions that have been amongſt us, <hi>the Land reeling too and fro, ſtaggering like a drunken man,</hi> it hath been the principal, the main ſupport to me: <hi>a godly man can never miſs his utmoſt end:</hi> Now this I know is a rule the School-men give: <hi>finis ultimus perficit tam agentem quam actionem:</hi> the utmoſt end is that that perfecteth the Agent and the action: the utmoſt end: why now that man can never be miſerable that attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his utmoſt end. Here is the miſerie of all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, they may attain many inferiour ends, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ends: I, but their utmoſt end they never obtain, therefore they are for ever miſerable. But now here is the happineſs of a Saint, he never fails in his utmoſt end: but as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of Gods anſwering his prayers, he did anſwer the hinge of my prayer, that he did: ſometimes I prayed for the thing, but God did not give me the thing: I, but the hinge on which my
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:168372:107"/> prayer moved, that is, that all might tend to Gods glory, and my good, in that God anſwered my prayer; and ſo ſhall a ſoul ſay at laſt: there were many things that my miſtaken judgement did think would have conduced to ſuch an end; but God ſaw it not good: therefore I obtaining my utmoſt ends, he lets Gods will go on in the world: and for my part I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, though many of my inferiour ends I miſs. Theſe are the quieting principles that ſhould be in your hearts, when you ſubmit to the will of God in his myſterious actings in the world. I dare not detain you any longer. Conſider I beſeech you what hath been ſpoken, and <hi>the Lord give you wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Works that God the Father gave his Son the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to do, are of two ſorts. They are either Acts of Miniſtery, or Acts of Majeſty: the firſt he finiſhed when he was here upon earth: For he ſaid, <hi>he had finiſhed the work given him to do:</hi> And he is aſcended up to Glory, that ſo he might perform the ſecond: (that ſo he might be both faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:168372:108"/> to God, and merciful to you:) For though he be aſcended up into heaven as our Lord, yet he ſits in heaven ſtill as the Fathers Servant: For this Cauſe though he hath changed his place, yet he hath not changed his office: you ſhall have him therefore in this Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> (which was indited from heaven) deſcribed ſutable to all his offices, according to the various Condition of the Church, as <hi>Brightman</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>pro varia Conditione Eccleſiae.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brightman.</note> He is deſcribed as the Churches Prieſt, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. He was ſeen <hi>wearing a Garment down to his Feet:</hi> In alluſion to the prieſtly Ephod, and the curious Girdle under the Law: for that I underſtand by that <hi>Veſtis talaris</hi> there, and not a deſcription of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs as ſome conceive it: then Chriſt though he be in glory, remains the Churches Prieſt: for he wears his Prieſtly Garments there.</p>
               <p>And he remains ſtill the Churches King, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>I ſaw a throne, and one that ſat upon it was to look upon like to a Iaſper and a Sardix ſtone,</hi> ſpoken of Gods ruling the Church in the Perſon of his Son.</p>
               <p>And he is deſcribed to be the Churches Leader and Commander. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns. Clothed with a veſture dipped in blood: And the Armies that were in heaven followed him upon white Horſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he is deſcribed as the Churches Prophet too. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. There he is ſet forth as <hi>a Lamb that hath ſeven horns and ſeven eyes: And he came and took the Book out of the hand of him that ſat upon the throne, and opens the ſeals thereof:</hi> And therefore he it is that receives all the diſcoveries of God towards his Church; and he it is that doth diſpenſe it unto the
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:168372:108"/> Church. <hi>Chap</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>And there was given a bow and a crown, and he went forth conquering and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer:</hi> Spoken of Chriſts prevailing by the Preaching of the Goſpel: as he is deſcribed in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.4,5. So that though Chriſt hath changed his place, yet he hath not changed his office, nor his Company: while he was here on Earth, he converſed with his people, <hi>and he walks ſtill in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to manifeſt that he was ſtill in office for his Churches good, that whatever he is, even after his aſcenſion, he is all for the Churches ſake: therefore ſhortly after he departs; he did as Princes uſe to do upon the days of their Coronation, <hi>ſpargere miſsilia,</hi> he ſcattered abroad, poured out certain extraordinary Gifts, to manifeſt that ſtill he had reſpect unto the Church: But theſe laſted but for a time; for this Cauſe after he had in his bodily preſence been abſent, yea and ſeemingly ſilent for about ſixty years (for its Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceived, that this book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> was penned about the latter end of the raign of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> the Emperour, which was ſixty years after Chriſts aſcention) now it was that <hi>he gave this Revelation unto his ſervant</hi> John, that it might be a ſtanding monument unto the Church, what his affections were, though he were now in Glory: therefore he leaves this unto them for their direction, that they might know what to expect in after Times, and what to pray for, and alſo for their Conſolation: though ſad occurrences were to come, yet the Lord lets them ſee the Event and Iſſue of all ſhould be for good.</p>
               <p>This is the ſcope of the Lord in this propheſie; he writes in this Book of two things: <hi>The things that are, and the things that ſhall be hereafter.</hi> Among which
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:168372:109"/> there are ſeveral propheſies that concern the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> of which, this is the firſt to the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may here be enquired, ſeeing there were ſo many other famous Churches in the World; the Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. to whom thoſe Epiſtles were written; how comes it to paſs, that the Lord Jeſus ſingles out only the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to write Letters from heaven to them, paſſing by all the reſt of the Churches?</p>
               <p>There are four Reaſons I meet with among Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters that are given hereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>Patmos</hi> (which was the Place of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baniſhment) was nearer to theſe <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, and the Conveyance to it eaſie by the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea; By this means being in Exile, he did indeavour to do them good, being ſhut out from the like opportunity from Churches more remote.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe theſe Churches were in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner part of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohns</hi> Charge; for though it be true, that the Apoſtolical Authority was univerſal over all the Churches, as their care reacht to all the Churches, and was not limited to a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as the Miniſters of the Goſpel now is: in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Attend to the flock, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you a Biſhop;</hi> though the Apoſtles were ſent forth to all the World, yet it plainly appears from <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. that they did by mutual conſent divide the World among themſelves, and did every of them take a ſeveral part of the world as their more eſpecial Charge, as they that write the lives and travels of the Apoſtles do clearly ſet forth; among the reſt theſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſs, are conceived to be the eſpecial part of
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:168372:109"/> 
                  <hi>Iohns</hi> Charge, and upon this Ground he takes eſpecial care to write to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some conceive it was, becauſe the Lord did foreſee that of all the Gentile-Churches theſe were neereſt to Judgement and ruine, to have the Candleſtick removed from them, unleſs their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance did prevent, and therefore he eſpecially takes Care to apply the Remedy where there was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger in the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some give a further Reaſon, making theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> types of all the Gentile-Churches afterwards unto the end of the World: What reaſon there is out of the Text for that, I ſhall not ſpeak to: only this I am ſure of; the Lord when he bids <hi>Iohn</hi> write, he writes the things that are, which are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and therefore I am not to confound them: But this is moſt true, if theſe <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches were not types of all the Gentile-Churches, yet certainly they were as it were the patterns, and all the Gentile-Churches were to take warning by them, that the ſame Corruptions were as truly incident to all the reſt of the Churches, which had now overgrown them: and <hi>Iohn</hi> having opportunity to write to theſe, doth by them admoniſh all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The words that I have now read unto you, are a Glorious deſcription of the heart of Chriſt in heaven, and of the care that Chriſt hath of his Church in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is true, that <hi>of him the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</hi> and he it is to whom Angels, Principalities and powers are made ſubject after his aſcention into Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. He it is to whom the Providential Kingdom of God is committed; for,
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:168372:110"/> 
                  <hi>he hath committed all Judgement unto the Son, Joh.</hi> 5.23. But yet notwithſtanding though he takes Care of the whole providential Kingdom, yet he hath an eſpecial eye on his ſpiritual Kingdom, he doth not forget his Lambs: the Kingdom of Chriſt in this world is made up of two Parts or Branches, Officers, or Members; both which are deſcribed in the Text.</p>
               <p>Chriſts care that he takes of officers; this <hi>he holds the Stars in his right hand:</hi> his Care of the Members, this <hi>he walks in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſhort expoſition I intend to give you upon this: Firſt, The Care that Chriſt takes of the Officers of the Church; and that you ſee is deſcribed thus, he holds the Stars in his right hand. Two things I muſt here explain.</p>
               <p>Firſt, here is a deſcription of the Perſons, they are Stars.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The act of Chriſts Care towards them, he holds them in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By Stars are meant the Officers of the Church. And that clearly appears from the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given by the Spirit of God in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver. ult. The ſeven Stars of the Angels of the Churches:</hi> where I pray obſerve, I cannot interpret Angels ſingularly, as referring to any one kind of Officers, as ſome do: But Collectively, as referring to all the Officers of the Church. The Reaſons I ſhall hint you to, pray note them: becauſe it hath been ſome kind of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in theſe latter days.</p>
               <p>The firſt is from the Title Angel, upon what Ground called Angel; It is a name firſt given to Chriſt, and from Chriſt derived and applyed to thoſe ſpecial Miniſters and Officers imployed under him; this
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:168372:110"/> I make appear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.15. <hi>The Angel that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me from all adverſity; the Angel the Redeemer,</hi> that is his name; Called therefore <hi>the Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. Now from hence, becauſe God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled his Son thus, this very name doth Chriſt himſelf convey to all thoſe that are Officers under him: and that it is a name borrowed from the old Teſtament, I ſhall clearly make manifeſt: and therefore it muſt be uſed in the ſame ſenſe: In the Old Teſtament I find it applyed to all Church-Officers: to Prophets, in <hi>Haggai</hi> 1.13. <hi>Then ſpake</hi> Haggai <hi>the Angel of the Lord, in the Lords Meſſage;</hi> there he is called the Angel of the Lord: yea, all Goſpel Miniſters are ſo ſtiled. In <hi>Iob</hi> 33.23. <hi>When a mans ſoul draws nigh to the grave, and his life to the deſtroyer:</hi> that is under the guilt of his own conſcience: <hi>if there be an Angel, an interpreter:</hi> ſo you are to read it: not only Prophets neither, but Prieſts are called Angels too: So you ſhall find, <hi>Iudges</hi> 2.1. <hi>There came an Angel of the Lord from</hi> Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <hi>to</hi> Bochim: a man would have thought it had been an Angel come from heaven: But it is an Angel that came frome <hi>Gilgal</hi> to <hi>Bochim:</hi> It was a Miniſter among men, as Interpreters expound it: But its ordinarily interpreted of <hi>Phineas</hi> the Prieſt: And his Meſſage drew ſuch tears from the people, that its called <hi>Bochim,</hi> the place of weeping: ſo ſome expound that place, in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.6. ſpoken againſt raſh vows: <hi>leſt they ſay before the Angel of the Lord, it is an over-ſight:</hi> the Angel of the Lord, who is that? Look to the 5. of <hi>Leviticus ver.</hi> 5. it will help you to expound that text: It was commanded of God, that all raſh Vows, the errors of them, ſhould be confeſt unto the Prieſt: therefore if the title Angel were given to all
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:168372:111"/> Church-Officers under the New: And cannot in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be applyed to any one ſort of Officers, as ſome have done it lately to Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The ſecond expreſſion is that of Stars, and that will evidence the thing unto you: By <hi>ſtars,</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are meant all men of great place or power, either in State or Church: Perſons of great place and authority in the ſtate; <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.9. where the Lord deſcribing the ſad Deſolations that ſhould befall <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Stars ſhall fall from heaven:</hi> when ſome people read that place, they conceive its ſpoken of the day of Judgement, and not of the downfal of that State: theſe ſhall be brought down from their ſtate and honour; and that is the meaning of that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.27. <hi>the Sun ſhall be ſmitten, and the third part of the ſtars.</hi> And its meant all perſons of great place in the Church; obſerve <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.10. from whence in all probability theſe expreſſions are taken: <hi>Antiochus waxed great over the hoſt of heaven</hi> (for ſo the Church is called) <hi>and caſt down ſome of the Stars to the ground, and trampled upon them:</hi> perſons of great place are commonly called ſtars: and the edge of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commonly turns upon them. When the Lord ſpeaks this to the comfort of his ſervants, that he holds the ſtars in his hand; it were but ſmall comfort to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour officers to tell them, the Lord holds the ſtars in his hand: that is great men, the higheſt officers, but not you, when as its ſpoken of them all: the Church is the hoſt of heaven, and all the officers thereof are the ſtars in Chriſts right hand: that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is the act of Chriſts care towards theſe? the text ſaith, <hi>he holds them in his right hand:</hi>
                  <pb n="689" facs="tcp:168372:111"/> it ſignifies two things, according to a double expreſſion in the Scripture: the right hand of Majeſty, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and ſo Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>ſit at his right hand.</hi> The right hand of power, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.76. I conceive the latter is here intended, and to be underſtood of that power that he doth uſe in mercy to put forth, for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, deliverance, and preſervation of his people: hence it is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.6. all deliverance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is called <hi>the ſalvation of his right hand:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rivet.</note> and therefore, <hi>De clementiſsima Protectione. Pſalm</hi> 22.7. he will protect them with his right hand in this life, and he will exalt them with his right hand in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Here give me leave to hint to you four things, before I paſs from this; mark them well, for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you.</p>
               <p>Firſt take notice from hence, that Church-Officers are but ſtars, and they ſhine but with a borrowed light, with a derived light; they have their light from <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs, the fountain and the Father of lights, Mal.</hi> 4.2. they muſt be Seers before they can be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> take heed therefore, though its true, that <hi>one ſtar differs from another ſtar in Glory:</hi> yet let no man exalt himſelf in regard of his own light: thou art but the veſſel, and haſt no more light then the Lord is pleaſed to put into thee: and remember while the ſtars ſhine tis night; though whileſt the night laſts the ſtars are needful: whileſt we live here, even the beſt men, they walk in the dark: and therefore the moſt glorious times of the Church ſtand in need of theſe ſtars. But the day haſtens when theſe ſtars ſhall diſappear for ever, for <hi>Chriſt will put down all rule, and all authority, and power,</hi>
                  <pb n="690" facs="tcp:168372:112"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. there ſhall be no more uſe of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Miniſtery for ever: But yet though the day approacheth, it is night ſtill: the greateſt light, and the moſt glorious diſcoveries of all the Miniſters in the world, cannot make day in the ſoul, or in the Church, unleſs the Sun of righteouſneſs diſcover himſelf: therefore let the people ſeek out for further direction, and get a light from Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs; which is a light that all the Miniſters &amp; Officers in the world cannot impart: for all the light that they can bring in, is but ſtar-light; and they are a woful people, and diſconſolate ſouls, that only live and walk by ſtar-light all their daies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſtars are in the right hand of Chriſt, that is, at his diſpoſe; therefore ſure he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them their Orbs where they ſhall ſhine; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the ſtars as well as the Candleſtick; that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is very obſervable, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. <hi>How Beautiful are the feet of thoſe upon the mountains, that bring glad tidings!</hi> What beauty is there to be ſeen in their feet! the meaning of it is, there is a beauty in the Meſſage that they bring: the Lord having made the Goſpel ambulatorie and itinerarie, that it is carried about from houſe to houſe, and from place to place, by the feet of the Miniſtery. Remember, you that enjoy the Goſpel, that ſad expreſſion in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Go to my place in</hi> Shilo, <hi>where I ſet my name at firſt, and ſee what I did there.</hi> Why, what did God there? <hi>he forſook the Tabernacle of</hi> Shilo. Remember the ſtars are in the right hand of God, and he appoints them where they ſhall ſhine: and one of the ſaddeſt Judgements that can befall a people in this life, is for God <hi>to ſeal up the ſtars:</hi> thats <hi>Jobs</hi> expreſsion in <hi>Job</hi> 9. that they
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:168372:112"/> ſhall not bring out a beam of light, but the people ſhall be left in the dark continually.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſtars are in the right hand of Chriſt; then ſurely there is protection for them, and a merciful care over them; they do but loſe their labour that think either to pluck the Saints out of the right hand of God; or the ſtars out of the right hand of Chriſt. Surely he will preſerve a Miniſtery in his Church unto the end of the world; or elſe blot that text out of your Bibles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. <hi>He hath given gifts for the work of the Miniſtery, for the gathering and perfecting of the Saints until we all come,</hi> &amp;c. Why did the Lord inſtitute the Miniſtery? For a double end: the one for the Gathering, the other for the Perfecting of the Saints: then ſo long as there are any of the Saints to be gathered: or any to be perfected, the end of the Miniſterie is not accompliſhed: God will uphold it until it hath attained the end of its inſtitution. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore what enemies thoſe are unto the Church of God, that endeavour to remove the ſtars out of their Orb: for, its that leaves a people under pure darkneſs, and a perfect night, and therefore its the worſt and the moſt pernicious deſign that ever was ſet on foot in the world: one ſtrikes at their calling, another at their maintenance: though the truth is, the intent of the work is the ſame, the Miniſtery, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the deſign of the workmen may be: Well, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God ſhould grant your deſire, for there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men that have been long hacking at the Miniſtery: Suppoſe it ſhould be as you would have it: give me leave to tell you two things; one is, when the ſtars are darkned, in Scripture it denotes great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, great plagues to come upon a people; <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.10.
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:168372:113"/> 
                  <hi>The Sun and the Moon ſhall be darkened, and the ſtars ſhall withdraw their ſhining.</hi> But further to clear what kind of Judgement you muſt look for: and pray mark, for I ſpeak nothing but Scripture unto you: in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.10,11,12. <hi>When the ſtars were caſt unto the ground;</hi> the text adds, <hi>The daily ſacrifices were taken away, becauſe of tranſgreſsion;</hi> caſt down truth to the ground: the daily ſacrifice, the worſhip of God; and truth, the word of God; Both will ſoon go down, if once the ſtars be caſt to the ground, and trampled on by the feet of pride.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, take this hint from it too: Its a great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only to have the ſtars ſealed up from you: but to have the ſtars to fight againſt you: an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that you have in the 5. <hi>Judges, the ſtars in their courſes fought againſt</hi> Siſera; there is not a worſe Army can be engaged againſt a people: obſerve, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.12. <hi>The Lord gave his Word, and great were the number of them that publiſhed it.</hi> What follows? <hi>Kings with their Armies did Flie;</hi> It relates to the Aſcention of Chriſt; that is plain by <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>thou haſt aſcended on high,</hi> &amp;c. the Lord did give his word at his aſcention, and there were a multitude of them that publiſhed it, and by this means Kings, Armies were put to flight: they conquered by the word: there is not ſuch another way to rout Kings and their Armies: Look into the 47. of <hi>Ezek. ver</hi> 10. and you ſhall ſee, this ſhall be the glory of the laſt times: the moſt glorious and moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times of the Church: <hi>And there ſhall be Fiſhers,</hi> the text ſaith: <hi>and the fiſh that ſhall be taken by them, ſhall be like the fiſh of the great Sea, exceeding many:</hi> a number of converts: take heed of the ſtars fighting againſt you, for you have need of theſe ſtars in the
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:168372:113"/> beſt and pureſt times. But the ſecond thing I mainly intend, the care that Chriſt takes of the body, which is deſcribed in the latter expreſſion: <hi>he walks in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks:</hi> he takes care as well of the meaneſt Member, as of the greateſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. <hi>The unction doth run down upon the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irts of his Garment:</hi> ſo doth his protection and his proviſion alſo: to explain this, here are three things to be opened.</p>
               <p>Why the Church is called a Candleſtick?</p>
               <p>Why a Golden Candleſtick?</p>
               <p>And what is it for Chriſt to walk in the middeſt of it?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Why is the Church called a Candleſtick?</p>
               <p>In <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. The ſeven Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches:</hi> there are four notions in it, and you muſt take in all, or you will not underſtand the meaning of the Word.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Candleſtick hath no light in it of it ſelf, but light muſt be put into it: and therefore the Candleſtick under the Law, to which this here is an alluſion, the Prieſts were to light the Candles: a Candleſtick hath no more light then is put into it, and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually maintained by a new ſupply of oyl, as you ſee it deſcribed in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.11. There are <hi>Olive-trees that grow on each ſide the Candleſtick, and they drop the oyl,</hi> &amp;c: here is no oyl prepared by the art and induſtry of men, but it is Natural Olive-oyl that doth of it ſelf drop: and therefore the ſupports and ſupplies of the Church are compared unto the <hi>rain, and unto the dew, that waits not for man, and tarries not for the Sons of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The uſe of a Candleſtick is for no other
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:168372:114"/> end then to hold up, and hold out the light, and to this very End the Lord hath inſtituted Churches: <hi>the great Ordinance under the Goſpel is the Church,</hi> though alas, we little conſider it: now pray obſerve, the great End why God inſtituted Churches was this: that he might have a company of Saints, that might hold forth his Word, and hold up his Worſhip: and for this Cauſe, <hi>the Church is called the pillar and ground of truth:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. The pillar of truth, why ſo? as one well obſerves, as a pillar holds forth a Proclamation; truth that upholds the Church: but the Church holds out the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Candleſtick is a thing moveable, and with the removing of the Candleſtick, you carry away the light alſo: and therefore the thing that the Lord threatens, is, that <hi>he will remove the Candleſtick out of its place;</hi> the Lord removes the Candleſtick from place to place; though the Land remain, the Church is gone, that is a dangerous Judgement: not only an immediate removing of the Ordinances, but of the Church, for which all Ordinances were appointed: the Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from them; <hi>he will call them</hi> Loammi, <hi>they ſhall be no more a people to him:</hi> the Lord will remove the Candleſtick, <hi>and the glory of the Lord ſhall depart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſty, Its an alluſion unto the Candleſtick under the Law in the Tabernacle, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.31. which was a type of the Church of God; for all things were done unto them in types, and yet with this difference: Under the Law there was but one Candleſtick in the Tabernacle; but here are ſeven Candleſticks: what is the reaſon? there is a double Ground, and both of them Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <pb n="695" facs="tcp:168372:114"/>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Church of God, under the Goſpel ſhould be of a larger extent then under the Law: and for that Cauſe happily it is, that the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Johns</hi> City go ſo far beyond that of <hi>Ezekiels;</hi> though it be ſpoken of the ſame thing, and of the ſame time: yet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> City, that is but 4500. Cubits, and Saint <hi>Johns</hi> is twelve thouſand furlongs. A great difference; But <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw it with Legal apprehenſions, he had a ſight of Goſpel-Ordinances by a darker light only: But <hi>John</hi> ſaw it with a Goſpel light, and he deſcribes the latitude and the dimenſions thereof according thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And that is the main reaſon: there was but one Candleſtick in the Tabernacle, becauſe the Church of the Jews was but one; and though they had many Synagogues, yet they met all in one ſtem, they were united all in one ſhaft; but the Churches of the Gentiles are many, and for that Cauſe, though there was but one Candleſtick under the Law, yet there are ſeven under the Goſpel; and that is the meaning why a Candleſtick.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why is the Church is called a golden Candleſtick?</p>
               <p>Upon a double Ground.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe Gold is the pureſt mettal, and the Lord will have his Church ſuch; they ſhall differ as much from other men, as Gold doth from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon clay in the ſtreets; the Lord is very exact in every thing in the Church; he is very curious of what mettle ſuch Candleſticks be made of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not every ſociety or conſtitution of men that will be lookt upon as a Church to Chriſt; but when <hi>the Lord lays the Foundation of a Church,</hi> he doth it <hi>with
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:168372:115"/> Saphirs: Iſa.</hi> 54. <hi>Non eſt de doctrina, ſed hominibus;</hi> there is a double Foundation of Churches, as Divines do obſerve, <hi>doctrinae &amp; perſonae;</hi> the Church is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on doctrines, but here of perſons; the Firſt founders of which the Church is built, they muſt not be common ſtones; for if the Church become corrupt, if the Gold become Droſs, <hi>if the houſe of the Lord become an outward Court,</hi> then the Lord will take no care either to build or to meaſure it: and there is Golden Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. The light that doth ſhine forth in this his Candleſtick; and then the Lord is curious with what oyl the Candleſtick is maintained; for the Lord will not have it maintained with common oyl, that Perſons may put in themſelves, but God will not delight in them; It is a ſtrange expreſſion, that in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.12. Theſe, empty golden oyl out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: their parts, their pains, and all, it muſt be golden oyl.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe Gold of all other mettals is the moſt precious, and of the higheſt eſteem; there is as much difference between the Church of God and other men, as there is between Gold and Dirt in the ſtreet; as between Diamonds and Pebbles in the Lords eſteem: make <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Church, and then, <hi>all the earth is mine, ſaith the Lord, but thou art my peculiar treaſure,</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. they are to God above all people; the truth is, they are the firſt fruits of all the creatures; the Church is called ſo, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.18. The firſt fruits were beſt, and were dedicated to God, and they did alſo conſecrate the whole crop; you all claim a title to Church-memberſhip; look they be golden Candleſticks; the Lord hath his ſcales to weigh you, and his touchſtone to try you, and let me
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:168372:115"/> tell you, the leſs Gold there is in any Church, the leſs value God ſets upon it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How is Chriſt ſaid to walk in the midſt of the Golden Candleſtick? It denotes a promiſe of eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence and fellowſhip: this is the promiſe that the Lord made unto the Jews, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.12. <hi>I will walk among you, and I will be your God, and my ſoul ſhall not abhorr you:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. I will dwell and walk amongſt them: it notes his preſence with them in all ways of love and Communion: for <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3. <hi>Two cannot walk together unleſs they be agreed:</hi> When God hath Communion with us, he is ſaid to walk with us; therefore we read of <hi>his goings in the Sanctuary;</hi> this then is the meaning, he affords his eſpecial preſence and Communion. Now here is an obſervation that I ſhall hint unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a gratious preſence of Chriſt with his Church in all Church-adminiſtrations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Scriptures hold forth this gloriouſly unto you; one is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.4. <hi>I would ſee thy beauty and glory as I have ſeen in thy ſanctuary:</hi> thy beauty, what is beauty? It is a ſymmetry and a proportion of parts: now when you look abroad on the works of God, you ſee one Attribute manifeſted in one work, and another in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: you ſee not theſe parts put together: and ſo the beauty of them doth not appear: God doth great things when he manifeſts an attribute when he would ſhew his love, he gives his Son: when he would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his mercy, he pardons ſin; ſo that in the Works of God, the Atributes of God are thus ſcattered, you cannot ſee them together. But come to the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and there you ſee beauty: all the Attributes of God are diſplayed there: for as Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:168372:116"/> is the ſtage on which all the Attributes of God are acted; for <hi>he is the Image of the Inviſible God:</hi> ſo is the Church the ſtage or ſcene on which Chriſt acts all theſe Attributes. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. There is the ſpecial preſence and beauty of God to be ſeen there, beyond what there is in all the world beſide.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is the great Glory of God to be ſeen in heaven; and you ſhall find that there is a great reſemblance between his preſence in his Church and in Glory: In <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22,23. When you read it, you will ſee but little difference between that and heaven, that you can ſcarce know it from heaven; <hi>we are come to the heavenly Jeruſalem, to the General aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in heaven; to God, the Iudge of all, to Ieſus the mediatour of the New Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> Let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a little the preſence of Chriſt with his Church, with that of his preſence in Glory: take the parrallel in theſe five particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt in heaven is preſent in Majeſty and Glory: It is called <hi>the throne of his Glory:</hi> and ſuch is his preſence in his Church too: And therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, <hi>he is ſaid to ſit upon a high Throne</hi> in the midſt of his Churches. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.3. The name of the Church is called <hi>Iehovah Shammah,</hi> on that account, <hi>the Lord is there; Ezek.</hi> 11. Chriſt doth nowhere but in heaven diſcover ſo much of his Kingly Majeſty, as he doth in the middle of his Churches and Church-adminiſtrations: and if the Lord once take away the vail that is upon our eyes, then we ſhall be able to ſee the glorious preſence of Chriſt in Goſpel-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. As I remember, <hi>Iunius</hi> when he read the Scripture, and the Lord had taken the ſcales off his
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:168372:116"/> eyes, to fee the Majeſty of it, <hi>repente divinitatem argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, Scripti majeſtatem authoritatemque ſenſerim, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go intervallo omnibus eloquentiae humanae praeeuntem, horrebat Corpus, ſtupebat animus;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iunius.</note> he ſaw a majeſty ſo far beyond all humane eloquence, that he confeſſes his ſoul ſtood amazed at it; ſo it would be to you; only there is a vail before your eyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In heaven the Lord is preſent as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind and will unto his people; the Saints in heaven know the whole mind of God, concerning what ever belongs to Gods Glory or their own duty: there <hi>we ſhall know as we are known,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. and ſo he is preſent in the midſt of his people; In <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.3. <hi>As his Saints ſit dowe at his feet, they all receive of his words;</hi> he gives forth what his will is concerning his Glory, and their Duty: nay, look to <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.22. <hi>They ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be written in their foreheads.</hi> It is not ſpoken of the Glory to come; it is <hi>new Ieruſalem that comes down from God out of heaven;</hi> and yet ſuch Glorious Diſcoveries there ſhall be of the will of God, and the mind of Chriſt unto his people, as if ſo be they ſaw Gods face in heaven; ſuch a Glorious preſence of Chriſt there is with his Churches.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In heaven there ſhall be a glorious and full Communication of all Grace; not only in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſecrets of his Counſel, they know his Will; but he will withold none of his graces from you; as your Communion ſhall then be perfect with him, ſo ſhall the Communication of all his grace be to you. Now you know, It is death that puts an end to ſin: mark it, it is death that puts an end to mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for <hi>he that is dead is free from ſin,</hi> 1 John 3.3.
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:168372:117"/> But it is the Beatifical viſion that perfects Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>reddit nos impeccabiles</hi> makes the ſoul impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, as the Schoolmen obſerve; there is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of this too in the Ordinances of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and Chriſts preſence in them. <hi>Beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, we are transformed into the ſame Image.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. <hi>ult.</hi> For <hi>there are before the Throne ſeven lamps of fire, and the ſeven ſpirits of God.</hi> Revel. 4,5. The Throne is Compaſſed about with a Rain bow <hi>ſignum gratiae,</hi> and it is not of many colours, but of one; to ſhew, how ſteady, and conſtant, and unchangeable, Chriſt is in his ways and diſpenſations towards his people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In heaven there is <hi>convolutio animae in deum,</hi> as the Schoolmen expreſs it; the ſoul is wholly as it were reſolv'd into God: Roled &amp; transform'd into God, that is, God wholly takes up the whole ſoul; that is all I mean: I would not be underſtood after that new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that men are deified with God: But as it is ſaid of <hi>the angels, they behold the Face of your heavenly Father continually.</hi> Mat. 18.10. never look off from him to eternity: there is a glorious reſemblance of this in the Lords preſence with his Churches; their eyes are faſtned upon the Lord <hi>their eyes watch for the Lord, mere then they that watch for the morning; their ſoul is ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> which is in the houſe of God; there is that ſweetneſs in the preſence of God in his Ordinances, which is next heaven it ſelf, when a man is made to drink out of <hi>the rivers of his pleaſure:</hi> ſome of Gods people can ſay ſo, <hi>one day in thy Courts is better then a thouſand elſwhere:</hi> there is a ſweeter taſt of God in Ordinances then there is any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the world beſides.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, in heaven there is the preſence of Chriſt among his Saints and Angels: if we ſhould ſee the Lord ſit upon his Throne, and all his Angels and Saints gathered together round about him, oh what a glorious preſence this were! but its ſo in all Goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations: there is not only Chrſt ſitting on his Throne in the midſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Elders compaſs his Throne;</hi> but then in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11. the text ſaith, <hi>there is a guard of Angels round about the Elders:</hi> Every time you come to worſhip God, Remember there is Chriſt upon his Throne, and Church-Officers compaſſing the Throne; and Church-members the people: and then the Angels as a guard about them.

                  <p>Firſt, how ſhould this command reverence in every ſoul of you when you come to have to do with any Church adminiſtrations! you do not conſider <hi>the King will come in to ſee the gueſts;</hi> you think it is but to hear a Sermon, to joyn in prayer, to go unto the Sacrament: but conſider not that you have to do there with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is preſent in Majeſty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: take heed therefore of all raſh approaches to Chriſt, and dealing raſhly in any Goſpel-inſtitution.

                     <hi>temere, ſine perſonae diſcrimine; then God will walk at an adventure with you:</hi> do not draw neer to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; for he is preſent at all Church-adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; there is a ſtrange prophaneſs of heart that men ſhew in it: and uſually <hi>an haſty heart makes a raſh mouth,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks: take heed therefore in all Church-adminiſtrations, of raſhneſs; for Chriſt is here, and he hath ſaid, <hi>you ſhall reverence my Sanctuary, for I am Jehovah:</hi> Let all be done <hi>with reverence and godly fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is there ſuch a gracious preſence of Chriſt in Goſpel adminiſtrations, labour to ſee it there, labour to have your ſouls affected with the ſpiritual preſence or abſence of Chriſt there; The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> could ſee <hi>the glory of the Lord go up from the Cherubims;</hi> but the people could ſee no ſuch thing; the Ordinances remained, and they were well pleaſed: yet though the Ordinances were not removed, the glory of the Lord was gon; and therefore have your hearts affected with this: look upon it as your great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſhould be with you as it was with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after Chriſts reſurrection; <hi>the Lord appeared to them, but their eyes were with-held, they did not know him.</hi> God diſcovers himſelf gloriouſly in Church-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and all the time thine eyes are with-held, and thou doſt not ſee it: I remember it was <hi>Bernards</hi> drift, and it argueth I confeſs a very holy Spirit in the man; <hi>Dico mihi</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in languore deſiderii mei, quis amat quod non videt? moriar ut te videam:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> he ſighs in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of his deſires, and intreats God to diſcover himſelf to him: Lord, I am willing to dye, to have a
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:168372:118"/> further diſcovery of thy ſelf: A man ſhould come into the preſence of God, with high expectations of the beatifical viſion; and every new diſcovery will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ the deſire to enjoy more Communion with God; and therefore preſs the Lord with fervent prayer, as he doth in that place, <hi>De amore Dei, ca.</hi> 1. <hi>quod obiter vidi accenſo deſiderio vix patienter expecto: auferas a me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tegentem:</hi> and the Lord can make a ſhort cut of it when he will; <hi>habet &amp; gratiae ſapientia ſua compendia;</hi> Deſire the Lord to take that hand of his from him, that hid him from his eye; is there ſuch a preſence? be not ſatisfied until thou ſeeſt it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Remember Chriſt is preſent, but he is preſent in holineſs; there is no attribute of God ſo terrible to a ſinful creature, as that of his holineſs; Juſtice and wrath are no way ſo terrible as his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and this attribute Chriſt ſhews forth in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in Ordinances: this attr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Laſtly, take notice he is preſent in jealouſie: <hi>You cannot ſerve the Lord:</hi> Why? in <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.19. <hi>for he is a jealous God:</hi> now there is a double fruit of Gods jealouſie, and do you tremble at the hearing of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if you come at an adventure with God in Church-adminiſtrations, the greateſt temporal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be inflicted upon you: look to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 10.2. <hi>The Angel of the Lord takes fire of the Altar, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters over the City;</hi> the Jews thought that the fire of the Altar did tend to nothing but to expiate their ſin:
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:168372:119"/> no, ſaith God, it ſhall burn the City to; no fire burns <hi>as coals of Juniper,</hi> like that fire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the Lord ſpare you in temporal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he will pour out ſpiritual judgements. I only put you in mind of one place of Scripture, in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 47.11. <hi>But the myrie and the mariſh places thereof, they ſhall not be healed, they ſhall be given to ſalt:</hi> What is the meaning of it? here is waters of Doctrine and Grace iſſue out of the Sanctuary: wherever theſe come, there is glorious healing: but there ſhall be under theſe Ordinances, myrie and mariſh places, where the water ſtandeth; new plagues ſhall light upon theſe places, they ſhall be given to ſalt: they ſhall be delivered over to perperual barrenneſs: <hi>let never fruit grow</hi> upon that ſoul, nor that people <hi>more;</hi> theſe are the ſpiritual Judgements that God will pour out upon thoſe that walk at an adventure with Chriſt in Goſpel adminiſtrations: for there is a glorious preſence of Chriſt in them; <hi>he walks in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks.</hi> So much for a brief Explication of this portion of Scripture.</p>

               <p>Its a great miſery to live without the Ordinances of God, to be out of <hi>the Valley of Viſion,</hi> and in the dark places of the earth; better is the <hi>bread of affliction, and the water of trouble, then a famine of hearing the word of God, Amos</hi> 8.11. yet it is much better to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a teaching-Prieſt, and without the Law, then to enjoy them to no other end, but with the higher hand to ſin againſt them, there is no burthen like unto that
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:168372:120"/> of <hi>the valley of viſion,</hi> Eſay 22.1. No <hi>woe</hi> like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>of Ariel,</hi> Eſay 29. The word is by ſome rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lyon of God, becauſe of the ſtrength of that City, and its power to ſubdue other Nations: that it is as a Lyon of invincible ſtrength, no beaſt of the field could ſtand before it: but others do render it the Altar of the Lord, and it is the name given to the Altar, Ezek. 43.16. <hi>The Altar ſhall be twelve cubits long;</hi> it is <hi>Ariel;</hi> ſo that they that had the ordinances of God, and the ſacrifices of God amongſt them, there is a wo unto them above all other people, though it were <hi>the City where</hi> David <hi>dwelt:</hi> ſo that they that abuſe their knowledge, and walk not anſwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: here you ſee, the Lord will ſurely reckon with them for their knowledge in the great day that he hath appointed to judge the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not only the knowledge, but the gifts of men, the gifts that men have received, they will alſo aggravate their ſin and increaſe wrath in the day of their account: the Lord will require nothing, where he hath given nothing; he will reckon with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants only for the talents that they have received: he doth not expect to reap where he hath not ſown; but where he hath committed a <hi>depoſitum,</hi> he will require it, and he will account with men according unto what their receits have been; and anſwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, ſo will their Judgement be; there ſhall be different degrees of puniſhment, anſwerable unto the different meaſure of Talents abuſed and neglected; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<pb n="708" facs="tcp:168372:121"/> him as a gift, and committed to him as a Talent. Secondly, They are not given or committed unto all in the ſame <hi>meaſure, but unto ſome much,</hi> and unto ſome little, in different meaſures. Thirdly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man hath much, or little, it is given or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, as that which <hi>he ſhall</hi> be called to an account for, it ſhall be hereafter required of him. Fourthly, The more any man hath received, the more ſhall be required of him in the general day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; mens accounts ſhall be anſwerable to their receits.</p>
               <div n="1" type="doctrine">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatſoever men receive from God, they are given them, or committed unto them;</hi> There is that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing fulneſs in him who is <hi>the fountain of living waters,</hi> that there is no man but receives ſomething from him, much or little every man doth receive, and theſe <hi>bleſsings are to</hi> be conſidered in a double reſpect; either as given, or as committed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are all given, and are to be looked upon as <hi>dona,</hi> gifts meerly of grace: a man can receive nothing, <hi>unleſs it be given him from above, Iohn</hi> 3.27. <hi>Every good gift comes down from him who is the father of lights.</hi> James 1.17. All good things are from above, and they come unto us only in a way of gift. There are but four ways of the conveyance of any thing one from another.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Ex debito,</hi> by way of debt, which is due to be paid, and ſo the Lord is debtor unto none: <hi>who can ſay they gave unto God firſt, and he ſhall be recompenced?</hi> and though by his promiſe, he ſeems after a ſort to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:168372:121" rendition="simple:additions"/> come a debtor unto us; yet its true, <hi>reddit debita, nulli debens;</hi> the rice of his promiſes are meerly his own grace, and his obligation by them is not ſo much unto us as his own faithfulneſs; that is true of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> touching all the bleſſings of God beſtowed upon men, <hi>Opus juſtitiae divinae ſemper ſupponit opus miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae, &amp; in eo fundatur.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aquinas.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ex pretio,</hi> By <hi>way of purchaſe,</hi> and ſo we have nothing to pay, for they are not our own.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ex merito,</hi> by way of deſert, and ſo we can have no right; for, <hi>when we have done all that is commanded, we are unprofitable ſervants;</hi> it cannot be agreeable to a created nature to merit any thing at the hand of his creator; even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf cannot be ſaid abſolutely, and in a full ſenſe to merit as Mediator, at the hand of God the father; and therefore grace was the foundation even of the merit of Chriſt himſelf; there is <hi>gratia unionis,</hi> and <hi>gratia unctionis,</hi> according unto that ordinary ſaying of the Schoolmen: <hi>Etiam meritum Chriſti habet Gratiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſceratam:</hi> and if <hi>the Mediatour who</hi> paid the debt, could not merit, much leſs can we.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It muſt therefore be <hi>ex dono,</hi> purely, meerly of gift; all our <hi>receits from God are of his grace: he ſhews mercy for his own ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are not only given unto them, but they are alſo committed to them, and ſo, that they are to be looked upon as <hi>depoſita</hi> committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: the one implyes grace in God, and cals for thankfulneſs; the other, truſt in us, and cals for faithfulneſs; the Lord is that great wiſe man ſpoken of in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.1. and he hath put his goods into their
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:168372:122" rendition="simple:additions"/> hands, that they may preſerve and imploy them: as there is no man that is <hi>ſine dono</hi> ſo there is none <hi>abſque officio</hi> they are all of them ſtewards but not proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, and the time of their ſtewardſhip will have an end, and then will the day of their account be: that as it is ſaid of the Jews, that the Scriptures, <hi>the Oracles of God,</hi> that they <hi>were committed unto them, Rom.</hi> 3.2. The word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they were concredited to them, or left to them as a <hi>depoſitum,</hi> which they were ſo to keep, as they were to tranſmit unto their poſterity ſo its true of all the pledges that the Lord doth betruſt his people with, they are committed unto them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited with them, as goods left in the hand of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; for every man is a Steward of ſome of the graces of God: and under this double notion all men are to look upon the bleſſings and mercies that they enjoy, not only as gifts beſtowed from the grace of God, but as pledges committed unto their truſt: and here interpreters upon this place do point us unto a double diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Ratione rei,</hi> ſo they are gifts to be received, that the free grace that is given may be acknowledged. Man in his fall had forfeited all his right to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God for he was now under the curſe of the Law: But the Lord did by a ſecond Covenant give all things into the hand of the Son; <hi>the Father loves the Son, and hath given all things into his hand;</hi> for <hi>he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed heir of all things;</hi> which cannot be underſtood of him as God, for ſo he is <hi>haeres natus;</hi> but as Mediatour, ſo he came under an act of the will of God, and is now <hi>haeres conſtitutus, Heb.</hi> 1.3. So that now the Lord Jeſus raigns, all Judgement being committed to him; the donation and diſpenſation of all things is
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:168372:122"/> now in his hand: he hath now a double ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of gifts: one is from common bounty, and the other is from peculiar mercy; the one by right of providence, and the other by right of promiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the one as ſervants, unto the other as ſons; the one as their portion in this life, and the other but as <hi>added unto the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, Matth.</hi> 6.32.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as Talents wherein our diligence and faithfulneſs is to be exerciſed, both in imploying and in improving; for there is no Talent but its given to trade withall, and being employed it will be encreaſed, for men do gain by trading; they are as the bread that Chriſt fed the Diſciples with, it <hi>multiplyes in the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and as the widdows oyl, <hi>it encreaſeth in the ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> for all that a man hath received here, it is in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto trading, whether it be grace or gifts: for all is given that a man might imploy it, and by imploying it, improve it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ratione perſonae,</hi> as they are <hi>data in ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem propriam,</hi> and <hi>commendata in ſalutem &amp; aedificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem aliorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome there are that are <hi>heirs of ſalvation, Heb.</hi> 1.14. and all the dealings of God do tend to prepare them for that great end, but to qualifie them for their inheritance, being they are as yet but in their nonage, that they may be made <hi>meet inheritors,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Secondly, All have not the ſame Gifts, but God hath appointed unto every one <hi>a meaſure of faith;</hi> Rom. 12.3.

<pb n="722" facs="tcp:168372:128"/> of Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh were number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as its ſaid, <hi>this was the firſt Miracle that he did,</hi> and <hi>this was the ſecond Miracle that Jeſus did after he came out of</hi> Judea <hi>into</hi> Galilee: So alſo the Miracles that Chriſt did work in glory are all numbered; as the Lord numbers the ſeveral degrees of his enemies downfal, in <hi>ſeven Seales, ſeven Trumpets,</hi> and <hi>ſeven Vials;</hi> ſo he doth number alſo the ſeveral degrees of his peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances; and 2 <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22. he doth number their ſins anſwerable unto the number of his mercies; <hi>they have ſeen my Miracles in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they have provoked and tempted me now theſe ten times:</hi> it is true that the mercies God beſtows on us are a <hi>multitude of mercies,</hi> and it is as eaſie for us to number the ſtars as it is to count them all; but though we cannot do it, yet God can do it, and he doth it, who can tell the number of the ſtars, and call them all by their names, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.15. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that he would <hi>ſhew forth the ſalvations of God all the day long, for I know not the number of them,</hi> &amp;c. and we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God hath his ſet number of mercies for a people; if they abuſe them and walk unworthy of them, he will not ſhew mercy for ever, <hi>he will not draw forth his loving kindneſs from generation to generation: Ceſſat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſus ſi in perpetuum aſcenſus ceſſat;</hi> as <hi>Beliſhazers Kingdom was numbered,</hi> the Lord wrote a memorial for him, ſo he will write a memorial upon ſome mercies, as the number of ſins is finiſhed, as Antichriſt hath his Numbers, <hi>the number of the beaſt is the number of a man, &amp;c.</hi> and mercies may have their number alſo: even your mercies: the Lord may ſay, Now your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is numbered, your deliverances &amp; victories are numbered, <hi>I will deliver you no more,</hi> as our Lord Chriſt
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:168372:128"/> after his ſatisfaction is ſaid to <hi>finiſh tranſgreſsion, and make an end of ſin:</hi> ſo men by their tranſgreſſions may finiſh and make an end of mercy alſo, it may come to its full number. Now why doth the Lord in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner record and number the mercies he hath beſtowed upon a people? ſurely it is in reference unto a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he will call them to an account for the place where <hi>he ſet them, on a fruitful hill; the wall he made about them</hi> of protection, <hi>the wine-preſs</hi> of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he ſet up in them, and the overthrow of their enemies that he wrought for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the abuſe of mercies is by God imputed to men, and puniſhed by him: <hi>wo to Ariel: Ariel</hi> was either the Altar of God where the ſacrifices were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or the Lyon of God, <hi>quod vicinas Gentes ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſſet:</hi> and yet there is a woe unto them: <hi>Have I been a Wilderneſs to you, or a Land of darkneſs? and what ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have your Fathers found in me? therefore I will be a Lyon unto</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and as a Leopard I will obſerve them.</hi> And what are theſe but <hi>ultimi judicii praeindicium?</hi> for now the reaſons of Gods Judgements are ſecret, and no ſoul ſees them, but the Lord will make it appear in the day <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>the day of Revelation of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgement,</hi> and all the Nations of the world ſhall ſee that it is not without cauſe all that the Lord hath done: therefore particular Judgements are reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of the general Judgement; its ſaid, <hi>the Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the moon into blood, Rev.</hi> 6.12,13,14. <hi>There was a great earth-quake, and the Sun became black as a ſack-cloth of hair,</hi> &amp;c. which ſome have miſapplyed unto the day of Judgement, becauſe of the reſemblance in the deſcription of it: but it hath a great reſemblance becauſe it was all in reference to
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:168372:129"/> it; therefore all the mercies that people do receive, they are in reference to an account.</p>

                  <head>Doctrine 4.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>anſwerable unto mens receits, ſo ſhall their account be;</hi> they that have received much, ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for much: and they that have received little, ſhall but for a little; he that hath received five talents muſt look to reckon for five: and he that hath received but two, ſhall count for no more; it is ſome kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto them that have received but a few talents, that they count but for a few; as he did comfort his friends that had but one eye, he ſhould count but for the ſins of one eye; and it is a comfort unto godly men many times, who have little of the things here below, that their account for them ſhall be leſs then many another mans; and it is a great ground of fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour unto them who have received much from God; ſurely great will their account be; ſome ſhall account for <hi>an hundred talents,</hi> and others but for few: indeed much mercy is ſweet in the receit, but it is ſad in the account; and yet thus it muſt be upon a double ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe all the mercies of God are given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal ends, and therefore they ſhall all of them be brought forth and accounted for in the eternal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; its true that the Lord hath ſome temporal acts that he doth in time, but he hath no temporalends; they are all of them eternal: and all that men do, all their actions alſo are in reference unto eternal ends; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall all be brought forth at the eternal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo ſhall all that the Lord doth alſo, and though
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:168372:129"/> the frame of this world ſhall ſtand but for a ſeaſon, yet the Lord will have an eternal glory thereby, when all the creatures ſhall be delivered from <hi>the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God;</hi> ſo though there be great variety of mercies given to the children of men, yet the glory that God ſhall have by them ſhall be <hi>everlaſting glory:</hi> as it is in our acts of ſin, though it be but for a ſeaſon, yet the miſery will be everlaſting: ſo though Gods acts to the creature in this life be but temporal, yet the glory of them will be everlaſting; there is not any one of theſe temporal mercies that you enjoy, but the Lord doth them to eternal ends, and therefore he will reap by them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory; and therefore ſome make that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that place, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>What ever the Lord doth, he doth for ever; ab imutabilitate;</hi> men can change none of the works that they do; indeed men may do works in one age, which the next age may deſtroy and pluck down; but men cannot do ſo of the worksof God: what he doth, there is no man can add to it, or take from it. For the ends of all Gods works they have all of them reference to eternity: he doth them all for an eternal end, which ſhall remain; when the work is deſtroyed, yet it ſhall attain its end, and ſhall redound unto his eternal glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe all the Judgements of God ſhall be <hi>righteous Judgements;</hi> now, righteouſneſs doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a proportion; therefore it ſhall be exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto mens ſins which they have committed; and to the mercies which they have received; it muſt neither exceed nor fall ſhort: there is a great deal of difference between acts of ſoveraignty and dominion in God when the will of God only is to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:168372:130"/> and the acts of his Juſtice wherein he will deal with the creature by a rule, and will plead with him in a rational way, ſo as he ſhall in the Judgements of God be his own Judge alſo; therefore he is ſaid, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.17. <hi>to lay Judgement to the line, and Righteouſneſs to the plummet,</hi> that is, <hi>ſumma equitate jus reddere.</hi>

                     <hi>Forer.</hi> Therefore the Lord will be very exact in it, in ſetting mens accounts in order before them; for Jeſus Chriſt ſhall Judge as man; <hi>by the man Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it ſhall be done in ſuch a way as men may be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of, and may underſtand the reaſon of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; that ſo they may juſtifie the Lord: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Saints</hi> are ſaid to <hi>Iudge the world,</hi> becauſe they ſhall be aſſeſſors with him when they ſhall hear the mercies that he hath beſtowed, and how he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of men his own again in that great day of their account.</p>

                  <p>But what is the thing that ſhall be required? it ſhall not be in the thing, but in the fruit: the mercy indeed God beſtows upon us, but he expects the fruit from us, and that he will ſurely require of us: and more particularly he will require theſe four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, with what hearts did you receive this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? did you receive it with a heart ſet upon the mercy it ſelf, or elſe was your heart carried out towards the God of the mercy? <hi>Hannah</hi> received mercy in a ſon: I but, ſaith ſhe, <hi>My heart rejoyceth in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.1.

                  <p>Secondly, how they are remembred by us? <hi>They remembred not his hand, nor the day that he delivered them from their enemies,</hi> was the charge upon them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.42. <hi>They ſoon forgot his works; nihil citius ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſcit;</hi> there is nothing that obtains in our hearts an act of oblivion ſooner then mercies, but they kept a yearly remembrance of it; there was an Ordinance for the remembrance of it made to that purpoſe in their generation, but it was not with affection and with like, it was but a formal thing. Now that is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaid not to be known, which is not known with an affecting knowledge; and ſo that is ſaid not to be remembred, which is not remembred with an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affection and impreſſion of ſpirit; the Lord looks what impreſſion Ordinances leave upon us, and what impreſſion mercies alſo leave upon us, and how the heart is moulded and faſhioned by the one and by the other; the Apoſtle ſaies, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>That we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things we have learnt, leſt we ſhould let them ſlip,</hi> &amp;c. the word is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Let me put ſome queſtions to you, to what ends you think God hath wrought deliverance for you? Firſt, was it that the Truths of God might be corrupted? <hi>In Ieruſalem there ſhall be deliverance and holineſs:</hi> and is the firſt ſtep to holineſs the ſubverſion of Truth?
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:168372:132"/> it remains as a brand upon their Tayls for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.7,10. <hi>Their faces were as the faces of men,</hi> and <hi>they were locuſts;</hi> they conquered whereſoever they came, <hi>but they had a ſting in their tails;</hi> they corrupted Religion whereſoever they came, and is the way to holineſs to corrupt truth? that cuts up holineſs by the root: ſhall it be ſaid, this is the Army that conquered all enemies, but generally poyſoned the people whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered? and ſhall it be ſaid in this age, men aſſerted the liberties of men, but corrupted the truths of God? ſhall we contend for every thing but truth? and this is a Truth, <hi>there are fundamentals in Religion:</hi> let ſcorners ſay, what are fundamentals? let me ſay, <hi>how long halt you between two opinions?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, were you delivered that your brethren might be oppreſſed, that ſome few men might ſhare Nations between them? <hi>I looked for Iudgement and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a cry;</hi> I, and its <hi>a cry that will enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabboth, every man is for gain from his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> and no man abates of his own private intereſt, whatever he can ſtretch forth his hand unto he takes, let the people be oppreſt, yea authority over-awed, rather then we be retrenched, we groan under the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples oppreſſions, and yet we are the greateſt oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, let all oppoſition be removed, that ſo none but we may oppreſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to trample the Miniſtery under your feet, and to remove that ſtanding Ordinance, <hi>to pluck the ſtars out of the right hand of Chriſt;</hi> but yet they will be preſerved notwithſtanding all oppoſition: and take the Jeſuites counſel <hi>Contzen,</hi> begin with them firſt, that there may be none able to maintain any thing in the

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, was it that the Ordinances of God might be by every one prophaned, and to turn liberty unto Libertiniſm, a free liberty to make Arminians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all manner of abominations, and they muſt not be reſtrained, no nor diſcountenanced, though the Apoſtle will not allow a man to ſhew that common humanity to them that he would do to a Heathen: <hi>Receive them not into your houſe, becauſe they bring not this truth;</hi> is there nothing men have to dally with but the truths of Chriſt? is there nothing to be <hi>turned into wantonneſs but the grace of God?</hi> it is the word of his grace; <hi>were we delivered to commit all theſe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you, nay, charge you, to beware of theſe things: elſe firſt your mercies will be witneſſes againſt you, and let me tell you, then the witneſs of mercies and of conſcience, there are not any more dreadful, but him who hath ſaid, <hi>I will be a ſwift witneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, your deliverance is then not in mercy, but in wrath; mens pleaſures may become plagues, and their liberty their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if you forſake God, then your deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will be your ruine, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.20. if you <hi>depart from him after he hath done you good,</hi> he will turn and do you hurt; but conſider the Lord doth make glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his people, <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be a quiet habitation,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad Rivers, Eſa.</hi> 33.21. Rivers, firſt for fruitfulneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.7. a fruitful land, <hi>a land of Rivers,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, defence, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. <hi>Whoſe rampant was the Sea, and

And whereas <hi>Siloah</hi> was a little River, what they wanted in the creature ſhould be ſupplyed in God, he would be a place of broad Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to them. But Rivers may give acceſs to enemies, as well as do good to the inhabitants; there were but two ſorts of ſhips, ſome for burthens, and ſome for war: but <hi>no galley with oars, or ſhips for war ſhould paſs;</hi> but the ſupplies from God ſhall be without any inconvenience, they ſhall receive good from God without evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider how mercies ſhall be avenged, there is no <hi>provocations</hi> like unto them <hi>of ſons and daughters,</hi> becauſe there are none that are ſo much againſt mercy; and thoſe mercies that are not returned in thankfulneſs and obedience, wil ſurely be required in puniſhment: in rewards the Lord doth not return unto men according to their ſervices, but he doth reward men in the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Avid</hi> now being grown old, his enemies being ſubdued, the promiſe that God made to him fulfilled, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſettled upon his head, and he was not only delivered from the danger of the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> but alſo from the fear of the houſe of <hi>Saul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he cannot let the remembrance of ſuch a mercy paſs without a ſong of praiſes (though for particular deliverances he made particular ſongs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:168372:135"/> that God might have praiſe is his end in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, and it ſhould be our end in deſiring mercy; and they are our greateſt aſſurance of enjoying of mercies, when Gods enlarging of his hand is alſo a means of enlarging of our hearts, for he doth expect no other ſacrifice but <hi>the calves of our lips:</hi> Here are four or five things that <hi>David</hi> here takes notice of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſets forth the greatneſs of the danger that he was in, <hi>the ſorrows of death compaſſed me round about,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the glory of the deliverance, and that was as an anſwer unto prayer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the fruit of it; and to be unfruitful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies is the greateſt barrenneſs, for they <hi>drop fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and not only the fruit of the lips, words <hi>in labris nata;</hi> but it muſt be from inward and hearty affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>e ſulco pectoris:</hi> God expects ſpecial fruit under mercies, or under croſſes, and if he comes to find fruit upon a figg-tree dunged, he will be much diſpleaſed if he find none: Now the fruit of the mercy is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the love of God is enlarged and inflamed, the more mercy a gracious heart receives, the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant he is in love to God, for our love to God is but by reflexion, <hi>we love God; becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> and the more the ſoul taſts of Gods love in a mercy, the more it doth draw forth in him love to God again; <hi>much was forgiven her, therefore ſhe loved much:</hi> ſo much is given to a Saint by God, therefore he loves God much.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his confidence in God is enlarged; <hi>the Lord is my rock and my fortreſs, my deliverer; and when I
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:168372:135"/> call upon him, I ſhall be ſaved from mine enemies, the Lord is the God of ſalvations, and to him belong the iſſues from death,</hi> and this God I have an intereſt in, he is mine by Covenant, and he is by my experience all this to me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he is by this quickned and encouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer, <hi>therefore I will call upon the Lord, and I will pray to him in all dangers, and my cry ſhall come before him, it ſhall enter into his ears,</hi> &amp;c. The proper fruit of mercy indeed, is the inflaming of a mans love to God, and the ſtrengthening of a mans faith, and his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and the inlarging of a mans heart in prayer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſets down the grounds of all theſe mercies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Gods free-grace <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe it was Gods good pleaſure, and from this fountain do iſſue all Gods mercies to the Saints, as Chriſt reſolves it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo was thy good pleaſure;</hi> nay the greateſt bleſſings that ever were beſtowed upon a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the higheſt advancement that the creature was capable of, the union of the humane nature with the God-head, to be <hi>ex nullo merito ſed gratis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, in the perſon to whom the mercy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, for as God ſtands in a peculiar Covenant-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his people, ſo he hath a peculiar providence over them, <hi>Job</hi> 29.4. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is upon their Tabernacle, and according to their integrity the Lord will appear for them, and own them in trouble:</hi> God is with his people at all times, but he is neareſt to them in the worſt times. And here there was firſt, <hi>Juſtitia cauſae; the Lord hath undertaken the cauſe of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:168372:136"/> and the relief of the innocent.</hi> Now they charged me with treacherie, with a deſign to kill the King, and to take the Kingdom as a man that raiſed ſedition, and civil wars in the Nation, the Lord knows, <hi>in this my integrity, according to the uprightneſs of my heart, and the cleanneſs of my hands hath he recompenced me.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Juſtitia perſonae,</hi> a legal righteouſneſs there cannot be, ſo <hi>there is none righteous, no not one;</hi> but there is that which in Gods account goes for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs evangelical, and that is ſincerity and <hi>truth in the inward parts,</hi> God delights in the works of his own ſpirit, and in rewarding the graces that he himſelf hath wrought in a man; <hi>Qui tribuit ut benefacerem, ſecundum puritatem factorum retribuit mihi.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> Auſt. <hi>in loc.</hi> Now he ſhews wherein this ſincerity doth appear in theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>I have not departed from God wickedly;</hi> that is, with a purpoſe and reſolution of heart to continue in a way of ſinning, and that is the property of ſincerity; a man indeed may be over-taken and ſurprized by a temptation, but it is not with a reſolution to forſake God, and to cleave unto the ſin, or reſt in it, he will not ſleep in it, ſpare it or favour it; that is, to do wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly againſt God, to have a double heart, and a double eye: to look upon two objects, partly at God, and partly at ſin; ſo to keep God, as to keep ſome ſin alſo, as it is with all falſe hearted men in the world, they look not upon god alone, let them pretend to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion never ſo much, yet they look not unto God alone but upon ſomething elſe together with God; as <hi>Herod</hi> he regarded <hi>John,</hi> but regarded his <hi>Herodias</hi> more; and the young man in the Goſpel, comes to Chriſt, yet he looks after his eſtate; and <hi>Iudas</hi> followed Chriſt,
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:168372:136"/> yet looks after the bag, this is to depart wickedly from the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>all his Iudgements were before me:</hi> a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and an upright heart <hi>hath a reſpect to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> as its ſaid of <hi>David, Acts</hi> 13.22. <hi>A man after Gods own heart, he muſt fulfil all his wills;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaſie duty, but difficult duty; not only thoſe that are in faſhion, but thoſe that are out of faſhion, and are diſcountenanced amongſt men; in the leaſt as well as in the greateſt; for <hi>the whole Law is written in the heart;</hi> and his obedience thereunto is univerſal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. And the more of Gods authority there is in the Law, the deeper impreſſion it hath upon the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I was alſo upright before him, and I kept me from mine iniquity.</hi> A ſincere heart hath the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolutions, the moſt unfeigned deteſtations, and therefore the greateſt and the moſt diligent watchings againſt his own iniquity, that ſin to which his nature is moſt prone, and wherein he is moſt apt (and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly been) to be enſnared.</p>
               <p>In the words are two things. Firſt <hi>Davids</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſincerity. Secondly, his teſtification of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I was upright <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> perfect, there is a two-fold perfection; Firſt a legal perfection, which is a perfect conformity in nature, and in life to the Law of God; ſuch as was in <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of his innocency, and this the Papiſts contend to be attainable even in this life; but here, <hi>Who can ſay my heart is clean? or I am purged from my ſin?</hi> therefore ſurely this was not the perfection <hi>David</hi> here ſpeaks of, for his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were known and confeſſed by himſelf, and
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:168372:137"/> remain upon record, known and read of all men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is an evangelical perfection, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection according to the tenour of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and this is two-fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in a mans Juſtification, and ſo a man is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſtified that is in Chriſt; for, <hi>we are made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.22. So we are ſaid to be <hi>compleat in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>by his blood to have no more conſcience of ſin.</hi> So the Church is ſaid to <hi>be all fair, and to have no ſpot in her;</hi> and ſo, <hi>by one offering the Lord hath for ever perfected them that be ſanctified; Heb.</hi> 10.14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a perfection of Sanctification, and this is perfect in the parts of it, that is, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. when a man <hi>is ſanctified throughout;</hi> that is, in every part, though he be not perfectly ſanctified in any part; perfect holineſs is the aim of the Saints upon earth, though it be only the reward of the Saints in heaven; and here God accepts of the will for the deed, and looks upon the things that they aim at as already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, for his end; in their <hi>predeſtination was their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the image of his ſon, Rom.</hi> 8.29. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that end, the Lord looks upon them as Chriſt ſhall preſent them, <hi>without ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing;</hi> ſo that they that are perfect, Firſt, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their holineſs. Secondly, in their aims. Thirdly, it ſhall at laſt end in perfection, <hi>When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away, and they ſhall be the ſouls of juſt men made perfect, Heb.</hi> 12. And it is this laſt that is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God aſcribes to his people; to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.9. to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Job</hi> 1.1. there is a perfection with men, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Concerning
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:168372:137"/> the righteouſneſs of the Law blameleſs;</hi> but though I know nothing by my ſelf, yet I am not thereby juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for the eyes of the Lord they are pure eyes, and he looks not as man looks; men look upon the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but God looks upon the heart. There are three expreſſions of this in the Scripture. Firſt, <hi>to walk with God,</hi> as its ſaid of <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5.22. and <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.9. Secondly, <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.2. God ſays, <hi>Walk before me;</hi> the word is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, having alwaies a reſpect unto his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing eye. Thirdly, there is a walking after God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Caleb walked after God:</hi> and <hi>to follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes;</hi> that is, in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the precepts of God, the providences of God, and the pattern and example of God, and theſe three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſet forth a choice perfection. Firſt, in all a mans waies to have an eye to Gods preſence. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſee God going before him in his precepts, and his providence, and example, to be imitators of him. Thirdly, to walk with him; that is, in all theſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Communion with him, and to approve a mans heart unto him, as <hi>David</hi> doth here, <hi>I was upright before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve: Firſt, that a godly man may have his heart upright and perfect, even in the imperfect on of his waies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a man that is ſincere is in Gods account a perfect man: ſincerity is the truth of all grace, the higheſt pitch that is to be attained here.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſinceerity of heart gives a man boldneſs, even in the preſence of God, notwithſtanding many failings. <hi>The Lord doth charge the Angels with folly, Iob</hi> 4.18. <hi>how much more man that dwells in a houſe of clay?
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:168372:138"/> David</hi> whoſe faith had failed, <hi>and he ſaid, I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of</hi> Saul; and his tongue had faltered alſo to <hi>Abimilech</hi> the Prieſt; three or four ſeveral lies he had told, yet <hi>David</hi> can ſay to God, that <hi>he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with him,</hi> for all that; it is a ſtrange boldneſs that the Saints have in the preſence of God, by vertue of the New Covenant, all their ſins ſhall be laid open at the laſt day as a canceld bond, that they wonder how they ſhall look upon them and not bluſh, but the ſame ſpirit of ſon-ſhip that ſhall give them perfect boldneſs then, doth give them boldneſs in a great meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in this life; that they ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>Neither height nor depth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the teſtification of it, how did he prove this perfection? Why by this, <hi>I have kept my ſelf from mine iniquity;</hi> the word in the Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſome interpreters do refer unto his enemies that he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corrupt affections that were ready to break forth, and in all this time he had very great temptations, but yet his care had been to keep them under, that they got not the power over him; ſometimes his unbelief did ariſe, and he was full of deſpairing thoughts: to ſee that <hi>all men were lyers,</hi> and the promiſe of God would fail them: ſometimes the revenge of his ſpirit did ariſe, that he had motions to avenge himſelf with his own hand, and ſometimes the impatience of his ſpirit in reference unto the mercy promiſed, that he could not ſtay Gods time, but to have uſed indirect means to accompliſh it: but he did watch againſt all theſe, and did not ſuffer them to carry him headlong, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there are ſome Interpreters that commonly refer itun to ſomeproper and peculiar evil, and way of
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:168372:138"/> ſinning that <hi>David</hi> had reſpect unto here, which the Fathers commonly call <hi>peccatum in delitiis,</hi> a mans ſpecial darling, and beloved ſin; and what ever that was, <hi>David</hi> teſtified his uprightneſs by it, that his care was to keep himſelf from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Keep himſelf]</hi> who made man his own Keeper? its the Lord that is his Keeper: <hi>He is the Keeper of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and the preſerver of man;</hi> if a man cannot keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſorrow, how is he able to keep himſelf from ſin? God indeed in our firſt converſion works upon us as he did upon the earth or <hi>Adams</hi> body in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, before he breathed a ſoul into it, and made it a living creature; ſuch a power as Chriſt put forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his grave; <hi>for we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> but yet being living, he muſt walk and act of himſelf, the Lord will have us to co-operate together with him, for we are built upon Chriſt, not as dead, but as <hi>living ſtones,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. The grace whereby we are made alive is his, and the power is his, <hi>he</hi> it is that <hi>works in us both to will and to do:</hi> when we perform any thing, and yet by his grace we do it alſo: <hi>ille facit ut nos faciamus, quae praecepit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So we are ſaid to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and <hi>to purge our ſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>and to keep our ſelves,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>he keeps himſelf that the wicked one touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not,</hi> &amp;c. Grace is <hi>the new creature a new nature:</hi> &amp; therefore hath ſympathy and antipathy anſwerable thereunto, to deſire the things that make for it, and to riſe up againſt the things that are againſt it, as all other natures in the world have a principle to ſeek their own preſervation.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, what is it for a man to keep himſelf from it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how and in what reſpects is this a ſign of a ſincere and a perfect heart?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, apply it?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what is a mans own iniquity? Here conſider, in every man by nature <hi>ſin doth reign,</hi> and a man is in juſt judgement given up unto the power of it; <hi>quod venditur, tranſit in poteſtatem ementis:</hi> but the reign of ſin is double, virtual and actual; virtual, ſo every ſin doth reign, for it is <hi>original ſin, the Law in the members</hi> that is properly the King, and in preparation as the Kingdom of ſin ſhall require; ſometimes it requires a man to commit this ſin, and then another, and many times makes men commit thoſe ſins that before they abhorred and ſtarted at the thought of, as we ſee it in <hi>Hazael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the actual reign of ſin, is commonly of ſome particular maſter-luſt, which is as the vice-roy over all
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:168372:139"/> the reſt of the ſins in the ſoul, and commands them all as Lord paramount, and makes them all ſubſervient and ſubordinate unto it, and this is according to cuſtom, calling, conſtitution, abilities, relations, and according to the different adminiſtrations of the ſpirit of God; for though God be not the Author of ſin, yet he is the Orderer of ſin. So that, it is that way of ſin and death that a man choſeth to himſelf, he having looked abroad upon all the contentments of the world, his own corrupt inclination doth choſe unto himſelf to follow with greateſt ſweetneſs and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and delight, as that wherein the happineſs of his life conſiſts; that as in the body there is in every one ſome predominant humor; So there is in the body of ſin alſo; That as in the natural man, though there be all the faculties, yet ſome faculties are in ſome more lively and vigorous then in others, ſome are more witty, ſome are more ſtrong, ſome quick of ſight, ſome have a ready ear, and others a nimble tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it is in the old man alſo, there is all the power of ſin in an unregenerate man, but in ſome more dexterous one way then another; as men in the choice of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſome have a greater inclination to one thing then to another, ſo it is in the choice of contentments alſo: as in the appetite for food, ſo it is in luſt, being nothing elſe but the appetite of the creature corrupted to ſome ſinful object.</p>
                  <p>As in the regenerate man, though there be the whole new man wrought, all graces at once, yet there are ſome peculiar graces wherein ſome men excell above others; <hi>Abraham</hi> in faith; and <hi>Moſes</hi> in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Job</hi> in patience; <hi>Joſeph</hi> in chaſtity; <hi>David</hi> in height of ſpiritual affections; <hi>Solomon</hi> in wiſdom; and
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:168372:140"/> in zeal <hi>Hezokiah:</hi> and therefore we ſhall in Scripture read it after, that <hi>there was none before him, nor none ſuch ſhall ariſe after him;</hi> it is to be underſtood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto their peculiar graces, wherein they did excell, as their proper excellency; ſo it is in the old man, there be peculiar corruptions, the whole body of ſin is in every man, but yet ſome ſins are more predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in ſome men more then others, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> for idolatry, and <hi>Herod</hi> his uncleanneſs, <hi>Baalam</hi> his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Cam</hi> his envy, <hi>Corah</hi> his gain-ſaying, and <hi>Eſau</hi> his prophaneſs, <hi>Iſmael</hi> was a ſcoffer, and <hi>Judas</hi> his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the young man in the Goſpel was a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is the ſin that a man may truly and properly call his own; and though the raigning power of this ſin be broken in a mans converſion, yet there are the remainders of corruption that Satan will aſſault a man again withall, and varniſh it ſo over, that the man ſhall fall in love with it; and as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of an apple which is rotten on the one ſide, men may not be drawn to like it when that is diſcoverd, yet if it looks well on the other ſide, a man may be induced by that fair appearance to taſte it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Satan will think to enter at the ſame door, and by the ſame <hi>Dalilah</hi> that he formerly prevailed with, he will try to prevail again; and the former pleaſure of the ſin will offer it ſelf to a man, ſo that even to a godly man it will be a hard thing <hi>to keep himſelf from this iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Secondly, there is no ſin that the heart of man is more perfectly ſet againſt: ind eed as a godly mans op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto ſin is univerſal, as well as his obedience unto God, there will be <hi>a hatred of every falſe way;</hi> but yet he hates that ſin moſt, and breaks out againſt it with the greateſt deteſtation, by which God hath been moſt diſhonoured, and whereby his conſcience hath been moſt inſlaved in times paſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>They ſhall ſay, what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly think their choiceſt gold ſcarce good enough to frame their Idols of, but now they think no place bad enough to caſt them upon, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.20. and 30.22. <hi>To the moles and to the bats,</hi> and they ſhall caſt them away as <hi>a menſtrous cloath,</hi> and ſay unto them, <hi>Get you hence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is in this above all other ſins moſt jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his heart; he fears it in reſpect of every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and opportunity, and temptation. <hi>Peter,</hi> his evil was frowardneſs and ſelf confidence; there was no ſin that after <hi>Peters</hi> fall he was further from, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Lord thou knowſt I love thee;</hi> no more compariſons now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Auſtin</hi> being often inſnared in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:168372:141"/> in his younger time, he was moſt careful to avoid all occaſions of it afterwards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this ſin he prayes moſt againſt; and if it be a Devil, thats the way to caſt it out, and uſually it will not go out any other way, he doth it by faſting and prayer, and calls in the aſſiſtance of Chriſt and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power for his preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he turns the edge of the threatning againſt this ſin; for the ſame method that the ſpirit of God doth uſe, that doth the ſoul alſo uſe, for ſin will die by no other ſword, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> ſin had been cruelty and oppreſſion, now he would have him break it off, by ſhewing mercy to the poor, as before he had made many poor: <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> that preached to <hi>Herod,</hi> who <hi>heard him gladly,</hi> yet he ſticks at his <hi>Herodias:</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> being to preach to <hi>Felix,</hi> a corrupt and a laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Judge, he doth it <hi>of righteouſneſs, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and judgement to come;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> met with their peculiar ſin, which was ſelfiſhneſs in the people, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the publican, and violence and rapine in the ſouldiers; and Chriſt to the woman of <hi>Canaan, Go call thy husband, Ioh.</hi> 14.16. And to the young man, <hi>One thing thou lackeſt, go ſell all that thou haſt;</hi> ſo, a man that knows the corruption that oftneſt leads him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he ſets the edge of the word againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly he doth endeavour to grow up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary grace, and ſtrengthens it by all means; as we ſee <hi>Zacheus</hi> his ſin was worldlineſs and defrauding, now he grew in reſtitution and liberality; the ſin of the Jaylor was cruelty, now he grows up in courteſie; and <hi>Paul</hi> was a perſecutor, but now a preacher: he thinks he can never do enough to advance and exalt that which before he did labour to his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:168372:141"/> to deſtroy, <hi>I laboured more abundantly then they all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How doth this prove a ſincere heart?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This doth ſhew a man to be truly affected with Gods diſhonour; there is no way of evil wherein he hath ſo much diſhonoured God as in this; now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſin, as a wrong unto God, that wherein he hath diſhonoured God moſt with, that he is affected moſt with.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is a ſin that he hath found the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan moſt in, and his own weakneſs moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt, and therefore againſt this ſin he ſets himſelf with the greateſt earneſtneſs, this <hi>his ſin did lie at his door</hi> in the guilt of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. which is a miſerable thing, <hi>talem habere Janitorem.</hi> This he did in the guilt of it, moſt fear, and therefore this in the power and dominion of it he doth moſt hate, which he doth ſhew a holy revenge againſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This ſhews the truth of a mans ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and his hatred againſt ſin: there be ſome members in the body of ſin, that a man can be content to have them pared when they grow troubleſom excrements, or prejudice him in his reputation or advance in the world: but now for a man willingly <hi>to cut off a right hand, and pluck out a right eye,</hi> when a man comes to that once, that he will not ſpare his darling, he may be ſure he hates ſin indeed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This ſhews forth the ſincerity of a mans love to God: for Chriſt ſaith <hi>he that loves Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more then me,</hi> Houſe or Land, that will not part with theſe when God ſhall call for them, <hi>he is not worthy of me;</hi> now if a man part with what is deereſt, then his love to Chriſt is in truth; <hi>Abrahams</hi> love to God
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:168372:142"/> appeared in this, that he did not ſpare <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſo we ſhould do as a token that Gods infinite love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to part with it; as <hi>he ſpared not his ſon,</hi> ſo ſhall we commend our love to God in this alſo, to part with that morſel that we have taſted the greateſt ſweetneſs in.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe.</head>
                  <p>Try the uprightneſs and ſincerity of your hearts by this: can you ſay that you have kept you from your own iniquity? many men profeſs Religion, and may go far in a form of Godlineſs, and yet ſtill their hearts run on after their former darlings. <hi>Job</hi> 20.11,12,13. A ſin that many a man carries with him to his grave, and a man lies down in his grave with his bones full of a ſin, that hath been bred and grown up with a man from his youth.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhould a man know what that ſin is?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It may be that which you may count a ſmall ſin, and that which may lie in lawful things; the yong mans darling was covetouſneſs, and the <hi>thorny ground,</hi> their luſts ran out in a lawful way, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 22. A mans individual love to a wife, to a child, &amp;c. may draws a mans love from God, and ruin him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſin may be ſo far ſnibbed and pruned by the word, that for a long time it may not appear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. <hi>A root of bitterneſs,</hi> yet it may lie hid as a root in the ground a long time, and a man may caſt it out at laſt, and afterward he may <hi>return unto his vomit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A mans darling may change with the change of a mans condition, and ſome occaſion that
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:168372:142"/> may preſent it ſelf; what was <hi>Sauls</hi> and <hi>Jehues</hi> Sin before they came unto the Crown we know not; but ſurely it was that wherein their luſt did afterward run out, the eſtabliſhing of the Kingdom upon their poſterity: wantonneſs may be the darling of a mans youth, and worldlineſs the darling of his age, and a mans being raiſed unto honour, and having the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities that he had not in times paſt, the luſt may run in another channel, he having now ſuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that before he never expected.</p>
                  <p>How may a man know what it is?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is <hi>that where a mans treaſure is,</hi> Mat. 6.21. <hi>there a mans heart is.</hi> Now all things do taſte beſt at the fountain, and grapes at the wine-preſs: Now a mans thoughts are the immediate iſſues of the ſoul; let me ask thee where are thy thoughts in the midſt of thy imployments? thou art impatient till thou have leaſure to take up thy mind wholly with thy treaſure; and as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when thou returneſt unto thy ſelf, thy retreats unto thy <hi>Dalilah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, What ſin is moſt ſweet to thee, and brings thee in moſt delight and pleaſure? <hi>Iob</hi> 20.11. It is ſweeter to a man then any thing elſe, all other ſins have not that ſweetneſs that this one ſin hath: it is the meat that his ſoul lives upon from day to day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Wicked mens dainties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſin a man favours moſt, and hides moſt, he cannot endure to have it croſt, as we ſee in <hi>Haman, Heſt.</hi> 5.13. being croſt in his ambition, if his darling be not pleaſed, all other things will do a man no good; and <hi>Herod</hi> alſo, he will part with any thing, till it comes to his <hi>Herodias:</hi> this is <hi>a ſweet morſel, he
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:168372:143"/> hid it under his tongue:</hi> cannot endure to hear it repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this ſin makes all the reſt of a mans luſts ſerviceable unto it; indeed men in their unregenerate ſtate do <hi>ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> but all other luſts are ſubject and ſubordinate to this one.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if God have had any dealing with thy ſoul, any treaties by his ſpirit in common works, what kept thee off from Chriſt? what was the <hi>remora</hi> that thou couldſt not come? it was <hi>Iudas</hi> covetouſneſs, and <hi>Herods</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and the young mans worldlineſs, after many heating motions, and they cool again, that man is in an ill condition, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The ſtumbling block of their iniquity, Luke</hi> 8.13. There is a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of temptation when ſuch fall away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, what ſin is it interrupts thee moſt in holy duties? for when all other luſts are kept out, Satan will be ſure to ſet theſe darling ſins on to ſpeak for him, and the corrupt part within a man will joyn with him that theſe may have audience, and when a ſubſervient luſt may not then be entertained, the darling may, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.27,30. after Chriſt had been upon the Mount, Satan tries their Communion by that, how their maſter-luſt will take with them.</p>
                  <p>Try your hearts, how you ſtand affected unto this from day to day, and ſo judge of the truth of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and mortification, and the meaſure of it by the ſubduing of your maſter-ſin, for there is not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſign of an unſound heart, then for a man to reſerve and delight in a maſter ſin, and that <hi>root of bitterneſs</hi> will in time ſpring up, and thou ſhalt again be defiled; and thou wilt afterwards <hi>return with the dog to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi>
                     <pb n="753" facs="tcp:168372:143"/> and it will be as a ſecret curſe from God to thy ſoul, and this ſin being only kept under for ſome time, it will as a dam to the water riſe the higher, and as fire covered, break forth with the greater violence, and make way <hi>for ſeven worſe ſpirits, and ſo thy latter end will be worſe then the beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould now have enlarged theſe motives, to ſtir you up to take heed of this ſin; as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this ſin will be the ground of thy Apoſtacy; <hi>the ſtumbling block of thy iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſin God will in Judgement give thee up to: reſtraining grace is a mercy: now for a man to have his luſt let out, for a man to be as wicked as he will, to be let alone in ſin, is a great Judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this will be thy torment for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. ſo much pleaſure as ſhe hath had, ſo much torment give her; the worm of conſcience ſhal be in the gnawing of this ſin above all others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould alſo have ſhewed you, that theſe darling ſins are either perſonal, or national, or Church ſins: and I ſhould have given you inſtances of each of theſe: as Firſt, for perſonal ſtubborneſs in <hi>Pharoah,</hi> gain-ſaying in <hi>Corah,</hi> envy in <hi>Saul,</hi> churliſhneſs in <hi>Nabal,</hi> ambition in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> intemperance in <hi>Felix, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, National; Curioſity in the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17.21. and cruelty in the <hi>Babalonians,</hi> robberie in the <hi>Caldeans, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, Church ſins, Idolatry was found in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, having thoſe amongſt them, that <hi>teach falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Balaam; and the Nicolaitans</hi> in the Church of <hi>Smyrna; ſuffering the woman</hi> Jezebel <hi>to deceive and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my ſervants,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Thyatira; having a name to live</hi> in the Church of <hi>Sardis; being luke-warm in the Church of Laodicea;</hi> and abuſing Church-power
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:168372:144"/> to the perſecution of the Saints in the Church of <hi>Rome; no man may buy or ſell that hath not the mark of the beaſt,</hi> and <hi>there is ſellingof the ſouls of men, and making merchandize of them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, perſonal ſins. I ſhould now have proved that there are ſuch ſins. Secondly, how a man ſhould know what it is in him that is his Darling ſin. Thirdly, that this ſin above all other ſins is to be denyed. But I cannot more enlarge; <hi>The Lord give you the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding. Let us look to God for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
